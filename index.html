So, let's get started and make coding a smoother, more efficient experience with GitHub Copilot by your side. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n# Setting Up GitHub Copilot for VS Code \n\n  \n\nNow that you have an understanding of what GitHub Copilot brings to the table, it's time to set it up in a code editor! While Copilot can be integrated into most popular editors and development environments, it integrates best with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), as both were developed by Microsoft. This section will guide you through the necessary steps to get GitHub Copilot up and running seamlessly. \n\n  \n\n## Purchasing GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nSadly, as the advanced comprehension required by GitHub Copilot needs the resources of many large servers, the service is not free. To purchase a subscription, simply visit the official [GitHub Copilot website](https://github.com/features/copilot), sign into your GitHub account, and get started. From here you only need to get it running in your development environment. \n\n  \n\n## Installing VS Code \n\n  \n\n### Windows \n\n  \n\n1. Visit the official [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). \n\n2. Download the Windows version of VS Code. \n\n3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. \n\n4. Once installation is complete, launch VS Code. \n\n  \n\n### macOS \n\n  \n\n1. Visit the official [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). \n\n2. Download the macOS version of VS Code. \n\n3. Open the downloaded disk image (.dmg) file. \n\n4. Drag and drop the VS Code app into your Applications folder. \n\n5. Launch VS Code from your Applications. \n\n  \n\n### Linux \n\n  \n\nOn Linux, the installation process can vary depending on your distribution. Here's a general guide: \n\n  \n\n1. Open your terminal. \n\n2. Depending on your Linux distribution, use the appropriate package manager to install VS Code. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use: \n\n  \n\n```bash \nsudo apt update \nsudo apt install code \n``` \n\n  \n\n3. Once installed, you can launch VS Code from your applications menu or by running `code` in your terminal. \n\n  \n\n## Accessing Extensions View \n\n  \n\nWith VS Code installed, now is the time to extend its capabilities in the Extensions view. This is where you can manage your VS Code extensions, including GitHub Copilot. \n\n  \n\n1. Open Visual Studio Code. \n\n2. Click on the square icon on the left sidebar (or use the keyboard shortcut \u003ckbd\u003eCtrl\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eShift\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eX\u003c/kbd\u003e on Windows/Linux or \u003ckbd\u003eCmd\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eShift\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eX\u003c/kbd\u003e on macOS) to open the Extensions view. \n\n \n\n  \n\n## Finding GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nIn the Extensions view, you'll find an extensive library of VS Code extensions. To locate and install GitHub Copilot, follow these steps: \n\n  \n\n1. In the Extensions view, type \"GitHub Copilot\" in the search bar at the top. \n\n2. GitHub Copilot should appear in the search results. Click on it to view more details. \n\n3. Click the \"Install\" button and VS Code will download and install GitHub Copilot seamlessly. \n\n  \n\n## Connecting Your GitHub Account \n\n  \n\nIn most cases, GitHub Copilot should prompt you to connect to your GitHub connect upon a successful installation. If this did not happen, follow these steps instead: \n\n  \n\n1. Open Visual Studio Code if it's not already running. \n\n2. In the top menu, click on \"View\" and select \"Command Palette\" or use the keyboard shortcut \u003ckbd\u003eCtrl\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eShift\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eP\u003c/kbd\u003e on Windows/Linux or \u003ckbd\u003eCmd\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eShift\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eP\u003c/kbd\u003e on macOS. \n\n3. In the Command Palette, type \"GitHub: Sign In\" and select it from the dropdown list. \n\n4. VS Code will prompt you to sign into your GitHub account. Click on \"Sign in with your browser.\" \n\n5. A web page will open, asking you to log in to your GitHub account if you're not already logged in. Enter your GitHub credentials and click \"Sign in.\" \n\n6. After successful authentication, you'll be asked to grant access to GitHub Copilot for Visual Studio Code. Click on \"Authorize Visual Studio Code\" to allow the connection. \n\n7. Return to Visual Studio Code, and you should see a confirmation message indicating that you are now signed into GitHub. \n\n  \n\n## Verification and Post-Installation Checks \n\n  \n\nAfter the installation process is complete, it's a good idea to verify that GitHub Copilot is successfully installed and ready to assist you with your coding tasks. To do this: \n\n  \n\n1. Look for the Copilot icon in your VS Code status bar. It should appear as a blue circle with the Copilot logo inside it. \n\n2.

With the recent creation of GitHub Copilot, a cutting-edge AI-driven coding assistant, developers can now code better innovations more easily and quickly than ever before. To show-off just how easy Copilot can make programming, this project will walk through crafting a factorial calculator. [Factorials](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) serve as a great example of a simple problem that has many applications in statistics and algorithm design, such as counting the many arrangements of a group of objects. Even if it has been decades since your last statistics class, this functionality can still be easily built by leaving the specifics of these mathematical properties to Copilot. \n\n  \n\n### Setting Up GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nBefore diving into this new way of coding, it’s crucial to be properly set up. For an in-depth guide on setting up Visual Studio Code, we recommend reviewing our [GitHub Copilot setup article](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/intro-to-github-copilot/articles/setting-up-git-hub-copilot). For those more familiar with the process, here is a high-level overview of what is needed to follow along with this project: \n\n  \n\n1. **GitHub Account:** If you don’t have one, sign up [here](https://github.com/). \n\n2. **GitHub Copilot Subscription:** Copilot requires a subscription to use. This can be purchased with the option of a free trial [here](https://github.com/features/copilot). \n\n3. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** While Copilot can work in a variety of code editors, it integrates best with VSCode. Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). \n\n4. **GitHub Copilot Extension:** Once you're in VSCode, head over to the left extensions sidebar and search for \"GitHub Copilot\". Install this official extension and log in to your GitHub account when prompted. \n\n  \n\n### Working with GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nWith the setup complete, the easiest way to get started with Copilot is just to start typing away. While you code as usual, Copilot will make suggestions to speed up your development and proactively prevent errors. More precisely, this loop looks like this: \n\n  \n\n1. **Start Typing:** As you begin typing in VSCode, Copilot will automatically provide suggestions. \n\n2. **Accept Suggestions:** Press \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e to accept the auto-completion if Copilot correctly understood your intention. \n\n3. **Ask Copilot:** If you're unsure about how to implement the next feature, just write a comment describing the problem in a comment, such as `// How do I...`. Copilot will then attempt to give you the answer as another code suggestion in your text editor. \n\n4. **Continue Coding:** Keep the momentum going, coding the functions easiest to implement for you, and letting Copilot take the lead when feeling stuck. \n\n  \n\n### Having Copilot Write the Factorial Function \n\n  \n\nNow that we know the workflow of working with GitHub Copilot, let’s kick things off with the backbone of our calculator: the factorial function. \n\n  \n\nFactorials are easy to calculate. They are the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the given number. For example, the factorial of five, written as `5!`, is `5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`.  \n\n  \n\nTo get started, create a new Python file called `factorial_calculator.py`. Then, have GitHub Copilot help write the function to calculate the factorial: \n\n  \n\n1. Start by typing `def factorial(n):` in your Python file. \n\n2. GitHub Copilot should automatically suggest code similar to the following: \n\n```python \ndef factorial(n): \n    if n == 0: \n        return 1 \n    else: \n        return n * factorial(n-1) \n``` \n\n3. Press \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e to accept the suggestion. \n\n  \n\nVoila! In no time at all, you've got your function! \n\n  \n\nDo keep in mind that while the above example is the most common way to calculate a factorial, it is also possible for Copilot to recommend a different solution entirely. For example, instead of recursively multiplying each integer, a loop could be used to calculate the factorial iteratively. This may offer better performance in certain cases and highlights why general technical knowledge is still important even when leaving the coding to Copilot. \n\n  \n\n### Prompting Copilot to Build User Input for the Function \n\n  \n\nUser input is a great example of boilerplate code that is often written very similarly regardless of the application. With Copilot, not only is this precious time saved for the programmer, but edge cases that may be glossed over until they cause errors can be proactively prevented. To start making the calculator interactive: \n\n  \n\n1. Begin by typing `def get_factorial_input():`. \n\n2. Wait for Copilot's suggestion, which should be along the lines of: \n\n```python \ndef get_factorial_input(): \n    \"\"\" \n    Prompts the user for a non-negative integer and returns it. \n    Keeps prompting until a valid non-negative integer is provided. \n    \"\"\" \n    while True: \n        try: \n            # Get input from the user \n            num = int(input(\"Enter a non-negative integer for factorial computation: \")) \n\n            # Check if the number is non-negative \n            if num \u003e= 0: \n                return num \n            else: \n                print(\"Please enter a non-negative integer.\") \n        except ValueError: \n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\") \n``` \n\n3. Accept the suggestion by pressing \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e. \n\n  \n\nNow, combine the two functions by asking the user for input and then calculating the factorial: \n\n```python \nnumber = get_factorial_input() \nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}\") \n``` \n\n  \n\nAnd just like that, not only has input been built for calculating factorials, but an edge case that may not have crossed the mind of most programmers has also been solved! This is the power of GitHub Copilot! Faster software development with fewer errors from having analyzed millions of lines of code.  \n\n  \n\n### Write Tests for the Code with Copilot \n\n  \n\nAs we just saw, there may be many surprise use cases for our code. To ensure that our code works as expected, we can ask Copilot to write some common test cases for us. \n\n  \n\n1. Start with `def test_factorial():`. \n\n2. Copilot might suggest: \n\n```python \ndef test_factorial(): \n    assert factorial(5) == 120 \n    assert factorial(0) == 1 \n    assert factorial(7) == 5040 \n    print(\"All tests passed!\") \n``` \n\n3. Accept the suggestion and run the tests with `test_factorial()`. \n\n  \n\nIt is important to verify that these test cases work as expected. While Copilot will likely get many things right, there is a chance that it may misinterpret the intended functionality of the program. This again highlights that while Copilot can very much improve the speed, and possibly the quality, of software developers, it cannot replace them. A human will always be required to verify that the code matches the real-world goals it was originally set out to achieve. \n\n  \n\n### Continuing Your Programming Journey with Copilot \n\n  \n\nGitHub Copilot isn't just a tool; it's a revolution in how people develop software. It seamlessly integrates AI into the programmer's workflow, making coding more accessible and efficient. By following this guide, not only did you craft a nifty factorial calculator, but you also took a leap into the future of coding. Use it well, and happy programming!

We will break down a couple that are powerful for daily tasks.\n\n### Git stash\n\nLet's say you're working on experimental code on a fresh branch and realize that you forgot to add something to a previous commit in order to continue your work. In order to go to a different branch, one must always be at a clean commit point. In this case you don't want to commit your experimental code since it's not ready but you also don't want to lose all the code you've been working on.\n\nA good way to handle this is by using `git stash`, which allows you to get back to a clean commit point with a synchronized working tree, and avoid losing your local changes in the process. You're \"stashing\" your local work temporarily in order to update a previous commit and later on retrieve your work.\n\nThe flow when using `git stash` might look something like this:\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-stash-pop-diagram.svg\" alt=\"In this diagram, a coworker asks the programmer if they can work on something else while they have their current code open. Git stash allows their current code to be stashed as they finish the other update. Git stash pop puts the code changes back into the working directory.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile working on a file, you find a small bug in a separate file from a previous commit that needs to be fixed before you continue. \n\n```\n$ git stash\n```\n\nRunning the command above will store your work temporarily for later use in a hidden directory.\n\nAt this point, you can switch branches and do work elsewhere.\n\nOnce the bug is fixed, you want to retrieve the code you were working on previously, you can \"pop\" the work that was stored when you used `git stash`. \n\n```\n$ git stash pop\n```\n\nFrom here, you can continue your work and commit it when ready.\n\nComing up we have a short video demo’ing this in action.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gL3Safgahk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Git log\n\nAt this point you might be familiar with the command `git log`, which allows you to view the commit history of the branch you currently have checked out:\n\n![Git Log output shows recent commit history](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log.png)\n\nThere are other ways you can use `git log` in order to view recorded changes. Here are a few examples:\n\n- `git log --oneline` shows the list of commits in one line format.\n\n![Git Log online output shows recent commit history all in one line](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-oneline-2.png)\n\n- `git log -S \"keyword\"` displays a list of commits where the number of occurrences of the keyword changes within at least one file via addition, deletion, or modification. In the screenshot below, we use `git log -S \"Add\"` to find any commits where the number of occurrences of \"Add\" within a file changes.\n\n![The output of `git log -S \"Add\"` finds a commit where the number of occurrences of \"Add\" changes within a file.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-S.png)\n\n- `git log --oneline --graph` - `--graph` Displays a visual representation of how the branches and commits were created in order to help you make sense of your repository history. When used alone, the description can be very lengthy, so you can combine the command with `--oneline` in order to shorten the description.\n\n![Git log --online --graph outputs a graphical representation of commits, showing where branches were created earlier and merged.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-oneline-graph.png)\n\n## Git commit amend\n\nGit’s `--amend` flag is extremely useful when updating a commit, it allows you to correct mistakes and edit commits easily instead of creating a completely new one. \n\nLet's say you finish working on a lengthy feature and everything seems to be working fine so you commit your work. Shortly after, you realize you missed a few semicolons in one of your functions. You could technically create a new commit, but ideally, you want to keep all commits specific, clean, and succinct. To avoid creating a new one, you could create your changes, stage them with `git add` and then type the command `git commit --amend` to update your previous commit. \n\nIt's important to note that although it seems like `--amend` is simply updating the commit, what Git actually does is replace the whole previous commit. For this reason, when you execute the command `git commit --amend`, your terminal editor asks  you to update your commit message:\n\n![git-amend](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-commit-amend.png)\n\nHowever, if you want to keep the same commit message, you can simply add the flag `--no-edit`:\n\n```\n$ git commit --amend --no-edit\n```\n\n## Git alias commands\nWhen grouping commands together, you can end up writing very long lines of Git commands in the terminal such as:\n\n```\n$ git log --pretty=format:\"%h %s\" --graph\n```\n\nFortunately, Git offers a helpful feature that can make your Git experience simpler, easier, and more familiar: aliases.\n\nIf you have a set of commands that you use regularly and want to save some time from typing them, you can easily set up an alias for each command using Git config.\n\nBelow are a couple of examples:\n\n\n```\n$ git config --global alias.co \"checkout\"\n$ git config --global alias.br \"branch\"\n$ git config --global alias.glop \"log --pretty=format:\"%h %s\" --graph\"\n```\n\nOnce the aliases are configured, next time you want to check out to another branch you could type the command:\n\n```\n$ git co example_branch\n```\n\nInstead of:\n\n```\n$ git checkout example_branch\n```\n\nUsing Git aliases can create a much more fluid and efficient workflow experience when using Git. By getting creative with your aliases, you're able to wrap a sequence of Git commands into one in order to save time and effort.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"0ddf89185869cb4e33b94bdd15cb84c3","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"41dac95eab590031fdfd96b778b43fdd":{"__typename":"Lesson","id":"41dac95eab590031fdfd96b778b43fdd","description":"Learn about a few different commands to switch between different versions of a Git project and when to use them.

When working on a project, things can scale rather quickly. Following a specific workflow allows the project to move in more orderly way.\n\nRemember that Git is defined as a version control system that's maintained on your local system. It helps you manage and record your source code history. GitHub, on the other hand, is a hosting service for repositories. Simply put, Git is the tool and GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.\n\nIn this lesson we'll take a look at the basic workflow used with GitHub, which goes like this:\n\n1. Create a branch\n2. Commit changes\n3. Create a pull request\n4. Review pull request\n5. Merge and delete branch\n\nBy sticking to that workflow, team members are able to isolate their work and avoid any conflicting code from being merged.

With Git, each teammate can create their own branch off of the main project in order to work on bug-fixes, new features, experimental code, etc. \n\nA branch is essentially a divergence from the main project. ​​When you branch out, git is essentially making a new state of your current code, upon which you can work, without affecting the important main state of the code. One can create as many branches as they wish and even create branches off of other branches.\n\nBy using separate branches, the main project remains intact and unaffected before the changes are reviewed and  merged into the project. \n\nEach repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, is called `main`. The `main` branch is usually the working version of a project and contains the production code, so it's very important to only merge clean and correct code into it!\n\nWhen someone wants to create a new feature, fix a bug, or just experiment, they should always create their own branch with a descriptive name. \n\nEach team will adopt their own best practices when working together and figuring out naming conventions. For example, the branch name `carlos_feature_dashboard_notifications` includes the author, branch type, and short branch description. Other teams may pick branch names to correspond to ticket numbers from their project management tool.\n","instructions":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"79be33a752d545876fbbafbb4d806781","sourceId":null,"title":"Adding and Committing Changes ","slug":"adding-and-committing-changes","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2021-10-28T18:59:17Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"container_type":"static-web","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2022-01-05T22:11:24Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"61d6178f5a19e700169a8867","slug":"blank-workspace","type":"static-web"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.3},"components":[{"__typename":"LayoutImage","id":"61d49fc30276cb000f76a238","type":"Image","image_url":"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-flow/github-flow-commit-changes.svg","alt_text":"commit changes"},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"617af4dc4380400012042d9d","type":"Narrative","content":"Let's assume you were recently assigned to a team to develop a feature for an app. You clone (download) the entire app repository from GitHub, create a new branch from the `main` branch for your feature, and begin coding a new file in your local Git environment. \n\nAfter testing your code and ensuring that everything is running correctly, it's time to commit the changes and push them to the remote repository!\n\nAs a refresher, the `git commit` command records changes to one or more files in your branch, assigning the commit a unique ID that identifies who created the changes, what changes were made, and _when_ the changes were committed.\n\nAdd a commit message describing your work and finally, push the commit to the remote GitHub repository.","instructions":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"c6b97bb86536d9169a7866a4b47e45c9","sourceId":null,"title":"Creating a Pull Request","slug":"creating-a-pull-request","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2021-10-28T19:09:51Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"container_type":"static-web","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2022-01-04T19:33:13Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"61d5d47b29505800258d8431","slug":"blank-workspace","type":"static-web"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.566667},"components":[{"__typename":"LayoutImage","id":"61d4a0f9295058001c8d8360","type":"Image","image_url":"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-flow/github-flow-open-pull-request.svg","alt_text":"open pull request"},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"617af5b485c821000ea06129","type":"Narrative","content":"At this point, your work is ready to be reviewed before it's integrated into the official project.

Specifically, we'll walk through creating your personal GitHub account, setting up Git on your computer, starting your first Git repository, and connecting that repository to a GitHub repository.\n\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you've completed the lessons on \u003ca href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLearn the Command Line\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLearn Git\u003c/a\u003e. Now, prepare to use those skills on your personal computer! If some steps in this tutorial are confusing, have no fear; it will all come together by the end.\n\n\n## What are Git and GitHub?\n\n\nThis tutorial refers to Git and GitHub repeatedly. *Git* is a widely-used version control system used to manage code. Git allows you to save drafts of your code so that you can look back at previous versions and potentially undo complicated errors. A project managed with Git is called a *Git repository*. \n\n\n*GitHub* is a popular hosting service for Git repositories. GitHub allows you to store your local Git repositories in the cloud. With GitHub, you can backup your personal files, share your code, and collaborate with others.\n\n\nIn short, GitHub is a tool for working with Git. There are other services to host Git repositories, but GitHub is a trusted, free service used by organizations across the world, big and small.\n\n\n## Create a GitHub Account\n\n\nTo use GitHub, you will need a GitHub account.\n\n\nIn your own browser:\n\n\n1. Open a new browser tab\n2. Navigate to \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://github.com/\u003c/a\u003e \n3. Create an account\n\n\nIf you already have a GitHub account, continue to the next exercise.\n\n\nAfter you sign up, you will receive a verification e-mail. Be sure to verify your e-mail address to GitHub by following the instructions in that e-mail.\n\n\n## Git Setup for Mac and Windows\n\n\nNext, we will set up Git on your personal computer. Follow the instructions for your operating system.\n\n\n### Mac users:\n\n\n1\\. Launch the **_Terminal_** application. You can find it in __/Applications/Utilities/__. You can also use the **_Spotlight_** search tool (the little magnifying glass in the top right of your screen) to search for **_Terminal_**. Once **_Spotlight_** locates it, click on the result that says **_Terminal_**.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n2\\. When **_Terminal_** opens, type in `git` and press enter.\n \n3\\. If you don't already have Git installed, a dialog will appear saying that \"The 'git' command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?\" Click \"Install\".\n\n![macInstall](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_prompt.png)\n\nThen click \"Agree to the Terms of Service\" when requested.\n\n![macAgree](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_terms.png)\n\n4\\. When the download finishes, the installer will go away on its own signifying that Git is now installed! Click \"Done\" to finish the installation process.\n\n![macDone](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_finished.png)\n\n\nNow skip down to the \"Final Setup\" section below to finish setting up.\n\n\n### Windows users:\n\n\nThis portion of the guide assumes you have already installed a program called Git Bash which allows us access to Git on Windows. If you have not installed Git Bash, please refer to the previous tutorial on Command Line Interface (CLI) Setup and follow the instructions for installing Git Bash on Windows. Once you complete that you can continue with this guide.\n\n1\\. Open the Start menu and search for the app, git bash. You should see ‘Git Bash Desktop app’ appear. Press Enter or click on the Git Bash icon to open the app.\n\n![gitBashOpen](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_start.png)\n\nA new window will open that looks like this:\n\n![gitBashShell](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_shell_edited.png)\n\nThis window is our CLI, where we will use our Git commands.\n\n2\\. If you want to make sure that Git is installed, run `git --version` in the CLI. You should see a response that gives you the version of Git installed. It will look like this:\n\n![gitVersion](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_test_edited.png)\n\nGit can now be used in the Git Bash app!\n\nContinue on to finish setting up.\n\n\n### Final Setup\n\n\n1. Navigate to GitHub's articles on setting up your \u003ca href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGit username\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eemail\u003c/a\u003e and follow the instructions for each using Git Bash. \n2. GitHub offers two authentication options, HTTPS and SSH, to keep your work secure. This is a security measure that prevents anyone who isn't authorized from making changes to your GitHub repository. In this article, we will use HTTPS. \n    * To authenticate yourself in the terminal, you will need to generate a _Personal Access Token_ on GitHub. Navigate to GitHub's article on [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) and follow the instructions for creating a classic token. Be sure to check the box that grants the token `repo` scope \u0026mdash; this will allow you to write to the repository from the terminal on your machine.\n    * Once you get the token, make sure to copy it or keep the page open \u0026mdash; you will not be able to view the token again once you navigate away from the page and you'll need it later in the instructions!\n\n\n## Try It Out!\n\n\nNow you have everything you need to practice your Git skills on your local computer. Take a moment to run the commands below to initialize a Git repository. We will use this Git repository again later in this tutorial so make sure you complete these steps exactly as described.\n\n\n1. `mkdir git_practice` to make a new directory to practice.\n2. `cd git_practice` to make the new directory your working directory.\n3. `git init` to turn the current, empty directory into a fresh Git repository.\n4. `echo \"Hello Git and GitHub\" \u003e\u003e README.txt` to create a new README file (more on this later) with some sample text.\n5. `git add README.txt` to add the new file to the Git staging area.\n6. `git commit -m \"First commit\"` to make your first commit with the new README file.\n\n\n## Your First Remote Repository on GitHub\n\n\nFinally, we'll create a repository on GitHub and then link it to a local repository on your computer. This allows you to backup your work constantly and safely, so you never need to worry about losing your work again!\n\n\nNow, let's connect our local Git repository to GitHub.\n\n\n### Instructions\n\n\n1\\. In your Command Line Interface, make sure your current working directory is your new Git repository. Navigate there if not.\n\n\n2\\. Check the status of which files and folders are new or have been edited. There should be no files modified.\n\n\n```\n$ git status\n```\n\n\n3\\. On GitHub, create a new repository by clicking the __New repository__ button on the home page. \n![newRepository](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_button.svg)\n\n4\\. On the new repository page, give your repository a name. It's not necessary, but it would be convenient to name it the same as the directory, **git_practice**. After naming the repository, click __Create repository__.\n![createRepository](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_creation.svg)\n\n\n5\\. After creating a repository, GitHub displays the repository page. At the top of the page, make sure \"HTTPS\" is selected.\n![githubHttps](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_https.svg)\n\n\n6\\.The repository is empty, so it's time to connect it to your existing work. Copy the Git commands on the GitHub page, under the title \"...or push an existing repository from the command line\", and paste them into your Command Line Interface. Running these commands will add a remote repository, and then push your local repository to the remote repository. \n\nWhen asked for a username and password, type in your GitHub username as the username and paste your personal access token as the password, pressing \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e (or \u003ckbd\u003ereturn\u003c/kbd\u003e) after each. Don't be alarmed if you can't see the characters you are typing, they are intentionally hidden as a security measure.\n![githubCommands](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_push.svg)\n\n\n7\\. Once your Command Line Interface reports that the push is complete, refresh the page on GitHub. You should now see the text you wrote earlier in the README file, \"Hello Git and GitHub.\"\n\n\nGitHub automatically displays the contents of a file named **README.txt** if it exists in the repository. The README file is the perfect place to write a description of your project.\n\n\nThere you have it! Your first GitHub repository, linked to your local Git repository. You've taken some huge leaps, so be proud! Now you can use your knowledge of Git to track progress on your local computer and push that progress to GitHub whenever you want. You can rest easy knowing that each step of your progress is safely stored in GitHub.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"74bb71f3f3d5998245e9bbef934502d9","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"a6c65e4516831c607a89421e8e12492e":{"__typename":"Article","id":"a6c65e4516831c607a89421e8e12492e","description":"Learn how to sign up for a GitHub account and share your code","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"what-is-github","title":"What is GitHub?","time":10,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What is GitHub?\n\nOne of the best ways to share what you've been learning with other people is to put your code on GitHub. GitHub is both a website and a service that facilitates software development by allowing you to store your code in containers, called _repositories_, and by tracking changes made to your code. In addition, it offers a hosting service and tools to build, test, and deploy code. \n\nGitHub uses [Git, a version-control development tool]( https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git), to manage your projects by tracking changes to files and allowing multiple people to work on the same project. Although both GitHub and Git have similar names, GitHub is a service, while Git is a development tool that can be used by you outside of and without GitHub. \n\n## Why is GitHub important?\n\nThere are many reasons why knowing about GitHub is important for your personal growth as a developer. A large part of the appeal of Github is the access it grants developers to the massive community of developers around the world who openly share their code, projects, and software development tools with each other. Therefore, if you want to continue working on your Git skills, creating your programming portfolio, or finding work, GitHub can help.  \n\n## How to Sign Up for an Account\n\nNow that you're aware of GitHub's benefits, you probably want to sign up for an account and try it out yourself. First, navigate to the home page of the GitHub website, [https://github.com](https://github.com). \n\nYou can click on the **Sign Up** button in the upper right corner or fill out your email and click on **Sign up for GitHub**, as highlighted in this screenshot: \n\n![Home page of the GitHub website with the **Sign Up** buttons highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-1-signup.png)\n\nYou’ll be taken to a page asking you to fill out your email. If you did so on the home page, it will already be filled out for you. If it isn’t filled out, enter the email you wish to use. \n\n![GitHub prompting for email with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-2-email.png)\n\nPick an email that you're comfortable sharing with peers and potential hires. Because of the way Git works, it's important to note that your email can be exposed publicly when you make a pull request or merge in code to a repository, making it visible to anyone looking through your projects. When you sign up for a new GitHub account, your email address is hidden by default.  \n\nOnce you have an email entered, click on “continue.” GitHub will then ask you to create a password. Fill out a password for your new account. \n\n![GitHub prompting for password with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-3-password.png)\n\nWhen you click on “continue,” GitHub will then ask you for a username. Fill out the user name you would like to use (you may need to try a few times to find one that’s available). \n\n![GitHub prompting for user name with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/Image-4-username.png)\n\nLike with email addresses, when choosing a username, it's wise to choose one you wouldn't mind future employers or colleagues seeing. A combination of your first and last name, like `firstnamelastname`, or using initials, like `i_lastname`, are good because they make it easy to find you on GitHub or identify you when you make [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) or [reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). Remember, you're likely using this account to share or access code. \n\nAlso be aware that usernames are first come, first serve and may not be available if someone else already claimed the username. Additionally, usernames may only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens are not allowed at the beginning or end. \n\nAfter you click on “continue,” GitHub will prompt to ask if you want to receive product updates and announcements. Make your selection and click “continue,” again. GitHub will then prompt you to solve a puzzle to prove you’re a human being. Click on “Verify” to view the puzzle. \n\nOnce you submit the solution to the puzzle, a “Create Account” button will appear. Click on it and GitHub will prompt you for an 8-digit code. GitHub will send you the code to the email you entered earlier. Enter the code from the email and GitHub will create your account.  \n\n## Settings\n\nOnce your account is created, GitHub will ask a couple of questions to personalize your experience. Fill these out or click on the “skip personalization” link at the bottom of the page. \n\nYou should now see a personal dashboard with a section for your projects and some messages: \n\n![GitHub personal dashboard](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-5-dashboard.png)\n\nNow you have your own GitHub account! You can continue to customize your account by:\n\n+ [setting your email to private](https://github.blog/2017-04-11-private-emails-now-more-private/) \n\n+ [setting up two-factor authentication](https://github.blog/2013-09-03-two-factor-authentication/)\n\nThat's it; you now have your very own GitHub account. 🎉\n\n## Recap\n\nWith more people working remotely and with teams distributed across different countries and time zones, GitHub and Git can be valuable tools for collaborating on projects. You can also use GitHub to work on any file-based project, such as writing documentation. \n\nLet's review what you did in this article:\n\n+ Learned that GitHub is both a website and service for storing and sharing code\n+ Learned that GitHub uses Git to facilitate software development by tracking changes\n+ Created your own GitHub account\n+ Enabled security features like keeping your email private and turning on two-factor authentication\n\n## Going Further\n\nOnce you feel comfortable navigating GitHub, consider doing the following:\n\n+ [Add information about yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile) in your profile, including an avatar, bio, location, etc.\n+ [Set your status](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile#setting-a-status) in your profile to let people know what you're doing.\n+ If you feel comfortable enough with Git, you can take a look at [this article on GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), GitHub's hosting service that allows you to create a personal website, \"project site\", based on a repository to make your portfolio site.\n+ If you're interested in paid accounts, GitHub has a [pricing page](https://github.com/pricing) with various types of accounts and features you can look at.\n\nShow the world what you can do with your code!","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"a6c65e4516831c607a89421e8e12492e","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"e228cb3d06c7bbe9909d54249e444d7a":{"__typename":"Quiz","id":"e228cb3d06c7bbe9909d54249e444d7a","description":"Practice what you've learned about GitHub Flow with the following quiz!","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":false,"published":true,"slug":"github-flow-quiz","title":"GitHub Flow","time":10,"type":"quiz","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"progress":{"__typename":"QuizProgressSummary","content_item_id":"e228cb3d06c7bbe9909d54249e444d7a","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T17:03:24+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T17:08:45+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T17:08:45+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":[{"__typename":"QuizResult","at":"1714064604160","correct":4,"total":10},{"__typename":"QuizResult","at":"1714064924999","correct":8,"total":10}],"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}},"total":10,"correct":8,"pct":80,"highest_pct":80,"passed":true,"passed_any":true,"taken":true,"type":"quiz","quiz_attempts":[{"__typename":"QuizAttempt","at":"1714064604160","correct":4,"passed":false,"percent":40,"total":10},{"__typename":"QuizAttempt","at":"1714064924999","correct":8,"passed":true,"percent":80,"total":10}]},"assessment_ids":["6197d3ef6cf8ac00228d381b","6197d45e3f4a5f0017ba756e","6197d4d03f4a5f0025ba74fa","6197d4617ff745000ece93fb","6197d462e97f910016ea6108","6197d462a84efb0016025e9f","6197d63396a1400025e36fa6","6197d636694a900012267506","6197d82fec2da200132a463a","6197d8d17ff7450021ce9402"],"assessments":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoice","id":"6197d3ef6cf8ac00228d381b","type":"multiple_choice","prompt":"What is the name of the starting branch when creating a new GitHub repository?","correct_answer":0,"answers":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`main`","reason":"Correct!

Invented by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004, Markdown provides a lightweight syntax to style any text document so that it can be converted to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) for viewing and publishing.\n\n## Differences between HTML and Markdown\n\nMarkdown translates to HTML, but Markdown is not a replacement for HTML. Markdown’s syntax can be converted to a small subset of HTML tags to do things like format text, add links, display images, and more. You can even incorporate HTML elements inside a Markdown document. To render Markdown in HTML, though, you would need a tool called a Markdown parser (more about this parser later on).\n\n## Benefits of Using Markdown\n\nWhy would you use Markdown? Compared to HTML, writing text in Markdown is much faster because the syntax is simpler. The [authors of Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) intended Markdown to be a language for writing styled text with syntax that is just as easy to read as it is to write. \n\nImagine that we are writing down some important text on a sheet of paper. If we wanted to emphasize the text we might underline it, twice even! Similarly, in Markdown, we could write:\n\n```\nTitle of My Document\n====================\n```\n\nNotice that we have plain text that has a row of equal signs (`=`) to produce a first-level header, also known as `\u003ch1\u003e`. On a webpage, the heading will display as such:\n\nTitle of My Document\n====================\n\nThe amount of `=`s don't matter so long as there's at least one and it goes under the text. \n\nFor text that's important, but not as important as a first-level heading, we might just underline it once. In code, we could use a row of hyphens (`-`), like so:\n\n```\nSub-Title of My Document\n------------------------\n```\n\nto produce a second-level header, also known as `\u003ch2\u003e`:\n\nSub-Title of My Document\n------------------------\n\nBoth examples are valid Markdown syntax. It is intuitive and normal for headings to be in either format. Alternatively, you can format headings using the `#` character. We'll show more examples of different headings, but for now, here's an example of valid syntax for a `\u003ch1\u003e` heading:\n\n```\n# Title of My Document\n```\n\nFurthermore, a Markdown document without any HTML tags can be published as is because its syntax is already made for easy viewing.  For example, the following Markdown document has: \n* styled a heading underlined with equal signs (`=`),\n* emphasized `week` in bold with double asterisks (`**`), \n* bulleted a list by prefacing each item with a number and a period, \n* and marked several lines as separate quotes with an angle bracket (`\u003e`) per quote. \n\n```\nMy Todo List\n============\n\nAt the end of this **week**, I plan to:\n\n1. Learn Markdown\n2. Write Markdown\n3.

Therefore, it doesn't require a strict file extension naming convention, such as **.md**.  As the [official Markdown mailing list](https://superuser.com/questions/249436/file-extension-for-markdown-files) explains, Markdown isn't meant to take over the format of a file. Any file extension that you would normally use to name your text document such as **.txt** or **.text** is appropriate. However, organizations such as [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) have a preference to expect Markdown documents to appear with an **.md** or **.markdown** extension.\n\n## Markdown Applications\n\nSince Markdown has gained a lot of popularity, you will find Markdown content being accepted in many applications. \n\n* Website publishers that accept Markdown content include [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/support/can-i-use-markdown-on-wordpress-com), [Ghost](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/ghost/) and [BeakerBrowser](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/guides/create-a-markdown-site). Tools such as [Jekyll](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/), [Docusaurus](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/docusaurus/) and [MkDocs](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/mkdocs/) can convert Markdown documents into a static website geared for technical documentation.  Take a look at this [page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) rendered in HTML, and its text [source](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics.text) styled in Markdown.\n\n* Book publishers such as [LeanHub](http://help.leanpub.com/en/articles/2941344-leanpub-flavoured-markdown-vs-markua-for-writing-in-plain-text) accepts Markdown manuscripts and convert them to books for publication.\n\n* Slide-show presentations such as [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/) and [Cleaver](https://jdan.github.io/cleaver/#2) can convert Markdown slides into HTML for web viewing.\n\n## The Markdown Parser\n\nA Markdown parser is software written to parse the Markdown syntax in a text document and convert it to HTML syntax. The original Markdown parser was written in Perl, but you can find parser [implementations](https://github.com/markdown/markdown.github.com/wiki/Implementations) today in almost any programming language. Regardless, a basic Markdown parser should support the [core Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics):  paragraphs, headers, blockquotes, phrase emphasis, lists, code, images, and links.\n\nThere are Markdown parsers that are freely available on the Web: [StackEdit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#), [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io), [Parse](https://parsedown.org/demo) and [Markdown to HTML Converter](https://markdowntohtml.com/). In addition to parsing and rendering, both Parse and Markdown to HTML Converter also convert the Markdown document to raw HTML so that you can copy and paste the HTML to be used elsewhere.\n\n## Markdown Tutorial\n\nLet's learn a little more about the Markdown syntax. As mentioned above, you can simulate a `\u003ch1\u003e` HTML tag with a `#` Markdown symbol. Since there are six heading tags for HTML, from `\u003ch1\u003e` through `\u003ch6\u003e`, you can simulate this with `#` through `######` in Markdown. For example this Markdown syntax:\n\n```\n# This is a H1 heading\n## This is a H2 heading\n### This is a H3 heading\n#### This is a H4 heading\n##### This is a H5 heading\n###### This is a H6 heading\n```\n\nwill render this:\n\n# This is a H1 heading\n## This is a H2 heading\n### This is a H3 heading\n#### This is a H4 heading\n##### This is a H5 heading\n###### This is a H6 heading\n\n\nIn addition to numbered lists, you can style a bulleted list too.  There are three different symbols you can use to mark a line item as a bullet: asterisk (`*`), plus sign (`+`), or hyphen (`-`).\n\nFor example:\n```\n* Markdown\n+ HTML\n- XML\n```\n\nproduces this:\n\n* Markdown\n+ HTML\n- XML\n\nFor best practice, it is recommended to use the same marker throughout your list instead of mixing them like above.\n\nThe core Markdown syntax does not include nested lists (list within another list), but it allows adding paragraphs between list items. To do so, you need to add a blank line after a list item and indent 4 spaces or 1 tab before starting a paragraph. Some parsers are lenient and do not enforce 4 spaces but there should be some spacing.\n\n```\n* Markdown\n\n   Markdown is a lightweight markup language for styling text.\n\n* HTML\n\n   HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.\n```\n\nFor more examples of basic syntax, check out [CommonMark's reference guide](https://commonmark.org/help/).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"5fdb8d6a1b7dc10012ee9d2f\" /\u003e\n\n\n## The Markdown Flavors\n\nBecause the core Markdown language supports only a subset of HTML features, many independent developers have extended the Markdown syntax to incorporate more HTML compatibilities and customize it for their own organizations. Here are a few popular flavors of Markdown:\n\n+ [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) is a body of special-interest developers who work side-by-side on a proposal to standardize the Markdown syntax and offer extensive test suites to validate Markdown implementations against this specification. This standard has been used by other developers to base their code upon.\n\n+ GitHub Flavored Markup, or [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is GitHub's expanded dialect of Markdown based on CommonMark and is used throughout the GitHub platform by its active community.\n\n+ [Trello](https://help.trello.com/article/821-using-markdown-in-trello), a popular collaborative tool that organizes and tracks information through virtual boards and cards, implements a custom version of Markdown as well.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou've learned a lot about Markdown, specifically: \n\n+ What Markdown is and how it differs from HTML\n+ How you can benefit from Markdown \n+ Where and when to apply Markdown in various scenarios \n+ How to write Markdown to style your text and make it presentable \n+ What a Markdown parser is and where to locate one \n+ Where to find other flavors of Markdown that are used in industry \n\nAmazing job getting this far! Don't be shy in applying Markdown in your next document. In fact, this article and many others like this on Codecademy were prepared using Markdown! See? We practice what we preach.\n\n\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"6fba6601220e1b9657e11e44908b106d","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T17:12:43+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T17:12:43+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T17:12:43+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"702044f78479af3df3ceb1baecf449aa":{"__typename":"Article","id":"702044f78479af3df3ceb1baecf449aa","description":"External article for learning Markdown.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"ext-art-mastering-markdown","title":"Mastering Markdown","time":10,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"→ **[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)**\n\nIn this article, you will learn how to use Markdown for styling text on the web, such as creating links and adding code blocks.

As implied in its name, a [README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) file is a text file that is meant to be read as soon as someone views the repository. This file contains text to introduce, explain, and share the information required to understand what the project is about.\n\n![Comic with three panels in which a character clones a GitHub project, gets confused trying to use it, and finally realizes after three hours that there’s a README file explaining all of the steps](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/write-README/github-README.svg)\n\nSince a README file is often the first thing a visitor sees, it should tell the viewer how to install and use the project. There is no one good way to structure a README but there is only one bad way: not to include a README at all.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"618c2dd22e75b70021b69d57\" /\u003e\n\n## Conventions of a Good README File\nYour README file should be as good as your project itself. \n\nMake your project stand out and look professional by at least including the following elements in your README:\n- **Project Title**: the name of your project\n- **Description**: This is an extremely important component of the README. You should describe the main purpose of your project. Answer questions like “why did you build this project?” and “what problem(s) does it solve?”. It also helps to include your motivations for the project and what you learned from it.\n- **Features**: If your project has multiple features, list them here. Don’t be afraid to brag if your project has unique features that make it stand out. You can even add screenshots and gifs to show off the features.\n- **How to use**: Here, you should write step-by-step instructions on how to install and use your project. Any software or package requirements should also be listed here.\n- **Technologies**: List all the technologies and/or frameworks you used and what purpose they serve in your project.\n- **Collaborators**: If others have contributed to your project in any way, it is important to give them credit for their work. Write your team members’ or collaborators’ names here along with a link to their GitHub profile.\n- **License**: It’s also important to list a license on your README so other developers can understand what they can and cannot do with your project. You can use [this guide](https://choosealicense.com/) to help you choose a license.\n\nKeep READMEs brief but detailed. README should always be up-to-date and self-explanatory. If you have spent a lot of time on your project, you should also spend a good chunk of time on the README. It can help your future self as well when you step away for a while and need to get reacquainted with your project. Not to mention it'll leave a positive impression on future interviewers who look at your GitHub profile.\n\n## Using Markdown to Format READMEs\nKeep in mind that nobody wants to read a long block of unformatted text bloated with information. That is why a README file usually has the `.md` extension. Formatting README files with Markdown can give them flair and make them interesting to read.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"5f3b4f656caaba00183ea90f\" /\u003e\n\n### Use Headers\nEvery title or section (usage, license, etc.) in a README.md should be formatted as a header. Using headers and adding some HTML, we can achieve stuff like this: \n\n\u003cdiv style=\"background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green;\"\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e📕 Codecademy Docs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDocumentation for popular programming languages and frameworks.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBuilt by the community.

Something like this\n```\n## Usage\nPlease follow these steps to get your application up and running.\n\n### Requirements\nThe following packages are required for this script to work.\n- pandas\n- numpy\n- requests\n\nTo install these packages, you can simply run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n```\n\nGitHub will find the headers and include them in a table of contents based on the header hierarchy:\n\n![An image of a README on GitHub showing a table of contents for the project called \"My Awesome Project\". The headers include \"What does it do?\", \"Usage\" with a \"Requirements\" subsection, and \"License\".](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/write-README/table-of-contents.png)\n\n### Level Up READMEs With Media\nDocumentation doesn’t have to be boring. Go for images or videos to make a project more understandable and appealing! We can add the project’s logo, diagrams, screenshots, or even GIFs!\n\nFor Markdown files living in a repository, the path to the image can either be to an URL or to an image file in the repository. For example, if we had an image named `diagram.png` inside the `images` folder of the repository, we could reference it like so `![Use Case Diagram](./images/diagram.png)` in the **README.md**.\n\n## Conclusion\nWrite engaging READMEs! Make sure they include easy-to-follow details for your project. This improves your documentation skills and makes you a better developer and communicator of code.\n\nIf you want to see more examples of good READMEs, take a look at the README on Codecademy’s [40Phaser](https://github.com/Codecademy/40Phaser) and [stuff.js](https://github.com/Codecademy/stuff.js) repositories.

We'll use a service called GitHub Pages to share our web page creations on the World Wide Web.\n\n\n## What is GitHub Pages?\n\n\nThere are many different ways to deploy a website to the public Internet. We'll be using GitHub's free service called GitHub Pages.\n\n\nWhy GitHub Pages? GitHub Pages offers a lot of features and flexibility, all for free. Some of the benefits include:\n\n\n* Easy setup\n* Seamless collaboration using Git and GitHub\n* Free hosting with \u003e95% uptime\n* Live updating with normal GitHub workflow\n\n\n## What is Deploying?\n\n\nDeploying is like publishing. When authors are ready for their work to be seen by the world, they publish it. When web developers are ready to share their projects, they deploy to the World Wide Web. Deployment is when a project is packaged and shared on the Internet. Unlike publishing, however, deployment may occur many, many times over the course of a software project.\n\n\n## Deployment on GitHub Pages\n\nDeploying to GitHub Pages is automatic. Once it's set up, deploying happens whenever you push your local changes to your remote, GitHub-hosted repository. Head to GitHub Pages' \u003ca href=\"https://pages.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esetup instructions\u003c/a\u003e and follow the steps exactly to get your main GitHub Pages page setup.\n\nWhen you first navigate to your newly deployed site it is possible that you will receive a 404 error. If this happens, and you are confident that you have followed all the steps as written, check back in 30 minutes to see if the deploy has successfully gone through.\n\n## Viewing Your Live Web Page\n\n\nThat's it! Your website is deployed to the Internet! You and anyone with whom you share this link can view your project by navigating in your browser to the URL `http://\u003cyour-github-username\u003e.github.io`.\n\n## Adding GitHub Pages Projects\n\nYou can set up your GitHub Pages to deploy every one of your repositories in addition to `\u003cusername\u003e.github.io`. This will allow you to ensure all of your sites are deployed automatically whenever you push to GitHub.\n\nIn GitHub, navigate to your `\u003cusername\u003e.github.io` repository and click __Settings__.\n![githubSettings](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20setup/githubsettings.png)\n\nWithin __Settings__, navigate to the __Source__ section within the __Github Pages__ section. From the dropdown menu, select __master branch__ and then click __Save__.\n![githubPagesSection](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20setup/githubpagessection.png)\n\nNow, all of your repositories can be found at `http://\u003cusername\u003e.github.io/\u003crepository-name\u003e`. Try creating a new repo with an HTML project inside it (perhaps push an old project to GitHub) and then navigate to the deployed page.\n\n## Deploying New Changes\n\nNow that your GitHub Pages site is set up, deploying new changes is easy. Every time you make a change to your site, use the normal GitHub flow. That is, use `git commit` and `git push` to send your changes to GitHub. After this, the GitHub site should update within a few seconds. Just refresh the page in your browser, and you're good to go!\n\nCongratulations on your first live web page!","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"6751c087006ec49fecbc2685310a8a79","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"62ae76d76f6f4321fb7eae061d54cb85":{"__typename":"Article","id":"62ae76d76f6f4321fb7eae061d54cb85","description":"In the following project, you will practice the commands associated with Git Rebase.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"github-rebase-off-platform-project","title":"Git Rebase Off-Platform Project","time":20,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"As a refresher, the Git rebase functionality helps branches keep up to date with the most recent changes in the main branch. We get a more linear history in the repository after rebasing. In this project, you will help two friends with their project of transcribing a story onto a GitHub repository.\n\nLet’s start with a bit of back story; Viraj and Noah collaborate to transcribe the children’s story of “The Little Black Fish” and store the text in a Github repository. They have broken the story into two parts, with Viraj working on part 1 while Noah types part 2. They track their progress in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/practice-rebase-off-platform-project)\n\nThey decided to work on separate branches to avoid conflicts in case there is any overlap. Viraj works in a branch named `part_1_Monday`, and Noah tracks his contributions in `part_2_Monday`. The main branch follows the most recent approved and merged work.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase-project/little-black-fish-two-branches.png\" alt=\"Screenshot: in the terminal, Git shows the most recent history of commits on the main branch.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nViraj and Noah started working on Monday and made some progress on their parts. They committed and pushed changes to their feature branches, `part_1_Monday` and `part_2_Monday`, respectively.\n\nNoah ends the day by creating a pull request and merging his changes to the `main` branch of the repository. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase-project/little-black-fish-two-branches-merge-changes.png\" alt=\"Similar to the commit history in the last screenshot, except the history now shows that changes from part_1_Monday were merged into main.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNote that both `main` and `part_2_Monday` track the same progress and `part_1_Monday` tracks its isolated progress while staying behind from the most recent changes. So let’s help Viraj keep his branch up to date with the most recent changes using the git rebase command. Please note that Viraj could alternatively pull origin main and merge the changes into his branch if he didn't care about maintaining all the interim commits. Nevertheless, we will proceed with rebasing to maintain the commits. \n\nLet's see if you can help them rebase the repository! [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/practice-rebase-off-platform-project) to your Github account and clone it onto your local computer. Make sure the input labeled \"Copy the `main` branch only\" is _unselected_ when you fork the repository \u0026mdash; otherwise, it won't copy the branches that Viraj and Noah are working in! Next, open a terminal and change your current directory to the directory of the local repository and visually observe the state of the branches: \n\n```\n\u003e git checkout part_1_Monday\n\u003e git pull\n\u003e git checkout part_2_Monday\n\u003e git pull\n```\n\nYou can use the following Git command to see a fuller picture of commits and progresses made in the branches: \n\n```\n\u003e git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all\n```\n\nNow, check out Viraj’s branch: \n\n```\n\u003e git checkout part_1_Monday\n```\n\nAnd rebase Viraj’s branch with `main`: \n\n```\n\u003e git rebase main\n```\nNotice that the `The Little Black Fish - Part 2` file in Viraj’s branch is updated with Noah’s changes. \n\nObserve the new state of the branches, visually: \n\n```\n\u003e git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all\n```\n## Walkthrough\n\nIf you need any more guidance to complete this project, we have a project walkthrough video for you:\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/85Lx8s_i4Yk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\nIn this tutorial, you applied `git rebase` in a repository.

It allows multiple people to work on the same project from anywhere. However, that doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of what GitHub has to offer. In this article, we will explore settings to customize our GitHub repository as well as discuss features that will take our repository to the next level.\n\nAll GitHub settings can be accessed by clicking the **Settings** tab on the main page of our repository. You can follow along with this article by opening your own repository settings!\n\n![A screenshot of a GitHub repository's settings tabs: General, Collaborators, Security \u0026 analysis, Branches, Webhooks, Notifications, Integrations, Deploy keys, Actions, Secrets, Pages](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/managing-a-github-repo/image-2-settings-menu.png)\n\n### The General Tab \n\nThe General tab allows us to change the basic repository information, such as its name and social media banner. It is where we can set a default branch. The default branch is the branch against which all pull requests and code commits are automatically made (typically this is already set to the `main` branch). \n\nIt’s also where we can enable or disable certain GitHub features like Wikis, Issues, Discussions, and more. We can also change merge options to only allow certain types of merges or automatically delete head branches. Most importantly, there’s the danger zone. \n\n#### The Danger Zone\n\n![A screenshot showing The Danger Zone in the Options tab of a GitHub repository's settings page.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/managing-a-github-repo/image-3-danger-zone.png)\n\nAs the name suggests, the danger zone is where one should take caution when changing settings. We can make a repository private or public, transfer ownership to another user, and archive or delete the repository.\n\n## Managing Collaborators \n\nBy default, only the owner of the repository or the organization can configure the settings of a repository and access the tools. We have to go through the repository settings’ Collaborators tab to grant other users or teams access. The specificity of permissions differs greatly between a user repository and an organization repository. \n\nAs always, we should use caution when granting permissions, especially to those outside of our immediate organization or team. They can make undesired changes to the code, host pages or packages on our behalf, or even leak private source code. \n\n### User Repository\n\nFor a user repository, the owner can easily add another user by clicking the “Add people” button and searching for their full name, email address, or username. The user will then have to accept the invitation. While the added user doesn’t have the same permissions as the owner of the repository, the user can still rename a branch and publish packages, among other things. For more information on the differences between the permission levels, check out [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository).\n\n![A screenshot showing the Manage Access tab of a GitHub repository's settings page. It shows a private user repository with four GitHub users added as collaborators.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/manage-repo/manage-access-collaborators.png)\n\n### Organization Repository\n\nGitHub Organizations provide its members a way to collaborate on multiple projects across multiple repositories. Owners or administrators of the organization can manage member access to the organization’s repositories. Adding a member to a repository is no different from the process in a user repository, with the exception of adding teams. In a GitHub Organization, admins can group members into teams and reference users by team names. You can read more about organization roles and their varying abilities on the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization).\n\n![A screenshot showing the Manage Access tab of a GitHub repository's settings page. It shows an organization repository with the organization members given different roles. The \"Admins\" team and a user are given the Write permission, and the \"Core\" team members, as well as one additional member, is given the Admin permission.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/manage-repo/organization-repo.png)\n\n#### Repository Roles\n\nBusinesses and institutions usually have a hierarchy that defines levels of authority and responsibilities. The same principles can be applied in a GitHub repository or organization; we don't want everyone to have admin privileges. Plus, it's strategic and secure to map levels of access. \n\nYou can check out [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) for a detailed breakdown of permissions for repository roles. You can also read about [creating custom repository roles](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization) to have a configurable set of permissions with a role name of your choice.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"619c4a7ce97f91001cea64e8\" /\u003e\n\n## Other Repository Features and Tools\n\nSo far, we've already discussed the GitHub features we will be using most of the time. However, GitHub has a ton of advanced tools and settings we should definitely take advantage of. While we will not be diving deep into these, we still want you to be aware of them so you can revisit them when the need arises. Each of the following features has a dedicated tab in the GitHub repository settings:\n\n- **Code Security \u0026 Analysis**: We can enable or disable a variety of security features for our repository. \n- [**Webhooks**](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks): We can use webhooks to get notifications when certain events happen. \n- **Email Notifications**: We can receive email notifications when push events are triggered. \n- **GitHub Apps**: Any open-source applications we use to extend our GitHub workflow or any third-party tools we integrate with GitHub will appear here. For example, Slack or CircleCI. \n- [**Deploy Keys**](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys): We can use the SSH keys generated here to grant servers access to a repository for deployment. \n- **Actions**: [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a powerful tool to automate, customize, and execute software workflows such as testing  The [Actions tab](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository) allows us to change the permissions. \n- **Secrets and variables**: Secrets are encrypted environment variables that can be used in Actions. \n- **Pages**: GitHub [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows us to host simple web pages straight from the repository. \n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"619c4c167ff745001cce9784\" /\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongrats on completing this article! It’s important to realize that GitHub is more than just a source code management tool. It has the ability to run tests on our code, host simple web pages, emulate our team hierarchy to designate permissions based on role, and much more! This is why we should spend time understanding and configuring all of the options available to us when creating a repository. Doing so will streamline our workflow and increase our productivity, making us happier developers at the end of the day.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"8d5a88da1bfe107f6d654ff010fa34fc","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},"966238249099bf86b1912f1bf87bfb01":{"__typename":"Article","id":"966238249099bf86b1912f1bf87bfb01","description":"This article explains what pull requests are, how to structure them to be concise, and why it’s important to do so.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"how-to-write-a-good-pull-request","title":"How To Write a Good Pull Request","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What Is a Pull Request?\nSonia, a new member of Codecademy’s engineering team, has just finished a snazzy navigation menu on a branch titled, “sonia_feature_navigation_menu”. Her changes will not be merged to the main branch until her pull request is approved. A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a feature of GitHub and other source code management tools to review code before merging it from one branch to another, usually the main branch.\n\nWhen Sonia creates a new pull request, her repository will automatically be set as the source repository and the project’s repository will be set as the destination repository. She will get the option to specify the source branch and the destination branch. She will be greeted with a preview of the changes between the two codebases and whether the branches can be merged automatically depending on code conflicts. In the Pull Request description field, Sonia must describe the code changes and what feature(s) this merge will add to the main branch.\n\n![An image showing that the sonia_feature_navigation_menu branch cannot be merged automatically into the main branch when comparing the two branches](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/branch-comparison.png)\n\nSonia’s proposed changes can then be accepted or rejected by her teammates. Each pull request has its own discussion forum, creating a place for collaborators to leave feedback. They will review Sonia’s code, suggest what should be removed or changed, and how her code can be simplified or improved. Any further commits Sonia makes to the source branch will automatically be reflected in the pull request. Once her changes are accepted by the project’s collaborators, her branch can be merged into the repository’s main branch. GitHub will keep this pull request in history as a record of the code change, Sonia’s contribution, and the discussion that took place.\n\nThis pull request process is not only a way to increase group knowledge or improve product quality but also an exceptional way to develop professional skills through group critique. Next, we will discuss how to write a good pull request.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61833ec19862e9000f9a8eb4\" /\u003e\n\n## How To Make a Good Pull Request\nCreating a pull request to present your work for feedback can be intimidating. We will dive into how to structure a pull request in a clear way that makes it easier for the author and the reviewers to discuss code changes.\n\n![A screenshot of \"Open a pull request page\" on GitHub.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/pull-request.png)\n\n### Follow a Pull Request Structure – What, Why, and How?\nConcisely explain the purpose of the pull request in the title. If the pull request adds a new feature, go for something like “Add frontend component for settings page”. If it’s to fix a typo, be specific and say “Fix name typos on the Contact Us page”.\n\nThe description is where all the juicy details are. You want the reviewers to know the thought process behind code changes and the options you have considered. It also helps to embed screenshots, GIFs, or even videos of your application so reviewers can anticipate what the code change in the pull request looks like.\n\nSome developers even have preconfigured templates or checklists on their repositories to ensure all pull requests contain just the relevant information. Following these guidelines help speed up collaborative critiques so the code can get merged faster!\n\n### Make Commit Messages Clear and Use Comments\nEven having self-explanatory commit messages and comments in the code makes reviewers’ jobs much easier. Consider the commit message, “OMG! It finally worked” versus the message, “Fix typos: add missing @ symbols in emails”. Moreover, adding comments in the code is always a good practice to help other developers understand the function of specific lines. It helps the reviewer in this case!\n\nOne feature of GitHub pull requests on the web interface is the ability to add discussion comments to any single line of code or chunk of code. This allows separation of concerns over multiple discussions.\n\n![A comment by a reviewer on a line of code: \"Let's make these variables lower-cased \u0026 snake-cased\"](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/comment.png)\n\n### Keep Pull Requests Small and Fast\nReduce the size of pull requests and respond to reviews quickly. Splitting big features into smaller parts is the best way to speed up review time. Not only does it result in less wasted work if the pull request gets rejected, but it will be easier to merge and review more thoroughly. Quickly respond to any feedback or requested changes. You want to ship code fast and make sure reviewers aren't stuck discussing an open pull request for ages!\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61834025d2454d001f3066e9\" /\u003e\n\n## Walkthrough of Two Codecademy Pull Requests\nPull requests allow a streamlined way for project team members to review the code of new features and bug fixes before it is merged to the main branch. To give you more exposure, we will be walking through the following two pull requests from the Codecademy GitHub organization.\n- A short pull request to [remove trailing spaces](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/pull/384) on the Codecademy [docs](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs) repository which is immediately approved.\n- A long pull request to [add a new component](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut/pull/1598) on the Codecademy [gamut](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut) repository which includes screenshots, comments, and a lively discussion before being approved.\n\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9EqP3GsE9N4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n  ","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"966238249099bf86b1912f1bf87bfb01","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},"c8f5d85e5c164f42ee9d438bed97d7dd":{"__typename":"Article","id":"c8f5d85e5c164f42ee9d438bed97d7dd","description":"In this article, we will learn how and why we should use a **.gitignore** file to make cleaner and more secure code changes!","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"using-a-gitignore-file-in-your-github-repository","title":"Using a .gitignore File in Your GitHub Repository","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What is a .gitignore file?\n\nWhat happens when our Git repository contains certain files we never want to commit to a shared or public codebase? We want to be careful that `git add` doesn't accidentally move them to the staging area. That’s where a **.gitignore** file comes in. **.gitignore** is a plain text file that tells Git to intentionally ignore changes in certain files. This also ensures that no other contributor in the repository accidentally commits those files.\n\n## Why use a .gitignore file?\n\nEach line in **.gitignore** corresponds to a file, directory, or pattern we would like to ignore when staging. Using a **.gitignore** file results in cleaner staging areas and prevent files containing sensitive information from being committed. Some of the files or folders we should ignore include:\n- Configuration files with API or secret keys such as **.env**\n- Compiled binary files or production directories such as **build** or **dist**\n- Log files\n- Dependencies downloaded from a package manager such as **node_modules**\n- System files such as **thumbs.db** on Windows or **.DS_Store** on macOS\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12d11155fec0025fe8568\" /\u003e\n\n### .gitignore in action\n\nLet's say we run `git status` and see that operating system files, such as **thumbs.db** and **.DS_Store**, are staged and will be committed!\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the result of running the command \"git status\". The result shows all files are staged to be committed including the operating system files such as \"thumbs.db\" and \".DS_Store\".](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/add-file-before-gitignore.png)\n\nLet’s ignore those files using their exact names. For example, if we add these lines to our **.gitignore** file:\n```\n# Windows OS file\nthumbs.db\n\n# macOS OS file\n.DS_Store\n```\n\nGit will ignore the special operating system files for Windows and macOS. These files will never be committed for this particular repository regardless of their location in this project. Note that in the file, blank lines are ignored and lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.\n\nAfter unstaging and running `git add .` again, the output of `git status` shows that the **thumbs.db** and **.DS_Store** files have been ignored!\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the result after running the command \"git status\" again. The result shows all files that are staged to be committed but this time, the operating system files such as \"thumbs.db\" and \".DS_Store\" are not staged thanks to .gitignore.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/add-file-gitignore.png)\n\nLet's go over how to write a file yourself!\n\n## Creating a .gitignore File\nWe can create a **.gitignore** file easily using a terminal editor like `nano` or `emacs`, or just using a File explorer. Don't forget the `.` before the filename!\n\n**.gitignore** is usually placed in the root directory of the repository. The filenames inside a **.gitignore** file can be written relative to the location of the **.gitignore** file. For example, we could add the line\n```\nsrc/main.js\n```\nto ignore the file **main.js** under the **src/** directory.\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the creation of a .gitignore file using the command \"touch .gitignore\". Next, the commands \"ls\" and \"ls -a\" are used to show that since .gitignore is a hidden file, the \"-a\" flag is necessary](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/create-gitignore.png)\n\n**Note**: since **.gitignore** is a hidden file, we will need to add the `-a` flag to `ls` to see it.\n\n### Ignore a directory with .gitignore\nSometimes we want to ignore entire directories or specify certain files in a directory. Common directories to leave out of a Git repository are **node_modules** or **logs** folder. We can ignore an entire directory by simply adding its name to **.gitignore**:\n```\nnode_modules/\n```\nThis will ignore the **node_modules** directory, and all subdirectories and files inside them. The forward slash `/` specifies that we are ignoring the directory.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12e039ee01700124c0bc1\" /\u003e\n\n### .gitignore Patterns\nWe can take advantage of [patterns](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) to match multiple filenames. These help us handle special cases such as ignoring specific file types or ignoring all but one file inside a directory. Some examples of things that make up patterns are:\n* Wildcard `*` to match 0 or more characters except for `/`. For example, adding `*.html` to **.gitignore** would ignore all files ending with the `.html` extension. `example*` would match any file starting with `example` such as `example.txt` or `exampleHtmlFile.html`.\n* Negation `!` as a prefix to negate any file that would otherwise be ignored. For example, \n```\nindex*\n!public/index.css\n```\nwill ignore all files starting with `index` except for `src/index.css`. But, we cannot negate a file inside an ignored directory.\n* Square brackets `[]` can be used to match a single character from a set of characters or a range of characters. Note that the range can be alphabetical: `[a-z]` or `[A-Z]`, numeric `[0-9]`, or a set of characters. If we added `index.[a-i]*` with both the square bracket and wildcard to **.gitignore**, we would ignore `index.css` and `index.html` but not `index.js`, since \"j\" is outside of the `[a-i]` range.\n* Double asterisk `**` is used to match 0 or more directories. If we had a **temp** folder inside all of the folders in the root directory and we only wanted to match files with the `.log` extension, we could use the pattern `**/temp/*.log`.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12f6bb2791a001c367599\" /\u003e\n\n## GitHub Provided Templates\nWhen we create a new repository on GitHub, we have the option to add a **.gitignore** file from a list of templates. These templates are pulled from [GitHub’s gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore). For example, below is the template for Java projects.\n```\n# Compiled class file\n*.class\n\n# Log file\n*.log\n\n# BlueJ files\n*.ctxt\n\n# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)\n.mtj.tmp/\n\n# Package Files #\n*.jar\n*.war\n*.nar\n*.ear\n*.zip\n*.tar.gz\n*.rar\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nGood job on completing this article! .gitignore files are incredibly useful to make sure our repositories are only tracking changes on relevant files. They also ensure that we can keep files with sensitive data out of the staging area. You’ll come across **.gitignore** files in almost every project on GitHub.\n\nThis file is shared by the repository, so make sure your patterns are correct and take your time with creating your first **.gitignore** file! \n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"c8f5d85e5c164f42ee9d438bed97d7dd","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},"f2c09be69043e44351a8d09c6607c02f":{"__typename":"Article","id":"f2c09be69043e44351a8d09c6607c02f","description":"Learn how to use Git Rebase in order to rewrite the history of your repository.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"git-rebase","title":"How To Use Git Rebase","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"When working with a Git repository, there will be a time when we need to combine changes from a working branch into another one. This can be accomplished with the use of the commands `merge` or  `rebase`. In this article, we’ll focus on `rebase` and see how it can work some magic in order to manage the future development of a product by simplifying git history. \n\n## What is Git Rebase?\n\nAt a high level, rebasing can be understood as “moving the base of a branch onto a different position”.  Think of it like a redo — “I meant to start here.” \n\nConsider that a team just completed a production release. While working on a completely new feature branch called `new_feature`, a co-worker finds a bug in the production release (`main` branch). In order to fix this, a team member creates a `quick_fix` branch, squashes the bug, and merges their code in to the `main` branch. At this point, the `main` branch and the `new_feature` branch have diverged and they each have a different commit history. We can visualize this in the image below:\n\n![A diagram showing that before rebase, branch commits stick out from the main line of development.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/before-rebase.svg)\n\nIf we want to bring the updated changes from `main` into `new_feature` one could use the `merge` command, but with `rebase` we can keep the Git commit history clean and easy to follow. By “rebasing” the `new_feature` branch onto the `main` one, we move all the changes made from `new_feature` to the front of `main` and incorporate the new commits by rewriting its history. We can see how this is done below:\n\n![A diagram showing that after rebase, commits over multiple branches get flattened into a single line.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/after-rebase.svg) \n\nWe can see above that the new “base” of our `new_feature` branch is the updated `main` branch with the previous changes from the bug fix implemented.\n\nOne of the major benefits of using Git rebase is that it eliminates unnecessary merge commits required by `git merge`. Most importantly, the history of the changes made in the main repository remains linear and follows a clear path of changes. This allows us to navigate the changes easier when viewing the changes in a `log` or `graph`. \n\n### Merge vs Rebase\n\nAlthough `git rebase` is an extremely useful tool to keep a Git repository clean and easy to follow, it doesn’t mean that one should _always_ stick to that command when integrating code changes. Let’s go over the definitions of `rebase` and `merge` one more time:\n\n- Git rebase: Reapplies commits on top of another base branch.\n\n- Git merge: joins two or more development histories together (creating a new merge commit).\n\nIn other words, Git merge preserves history as it happened, whereas rebase rewrites it. \n\nGenerally, if one is dealing with numerous branches, and the commit graph becomes really difficult to read, it can be very useful to use rebase instead of merge. Since Git rebase creates a linear history, it can be a lot easier to visualize the changes made and get a cleaner graph.\n\n![In the diagram, the history from only using Git merge shows lots of different paths representing different branches. Next to it, the path from using Git rebase is one straight line, with commits from a feature branch getting represented as a commit on the main branch.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/git-merge-vs-git-rebase.svg)\n\nIn the end, each team will develop their preferred method of integrating changes and preserving history. \nGenerally, it’s useful to use `merge` whenever we want to add changes of a branch **back** into the base branch. And `rebase` is useful whenever we want to add **changes of a base branch** back to a branched out branch. \n\n### Disadvantages of using rebase\n\nAs useful as Git rebase can be, it doesn’t come without risks. When using `git rebase` in our workflow it’s imperative to understand that rebase is a **destructive operation** and creates _new_ commits, which can make it complicated to track the context of any changes made. One common rule when using rebase is to only use it locally. That is to say, once something has been pushed then **do not** rebase it after that. Otherwise, things can get convoluted when rewriting history on a remote. \n\nSince we’re rewriting history we will also have to solve more commit conflicts. When we merge a branch, we only need to solve the conflicts once straight into the merge commit. However, when using rebase we might end up having to solve similar conflicts in previous commits that are being rewritten because rebase practically cherry-picks each commit individually and attempts to merge it in. If a commit introduces a conflict, rebase will complain about it even if the conflict is fixed in subsequent commits. In order to reduce the number of merge conflicts, it's suggested to rebase often and to also squash changes into one commit as much as possible.\n\nMoreover, make sure that the branch we're working on is not a shared branch. A shared branch meaning a branch that exists on the distant repository and that other people on our team could pull. Why should we avoid this? Well, remember that rebasing changes **commit history**. So if we share our commits publicly, and others start additional work based on those commits, our trees are no longer in sync after rebasing. As a golden rule, it’s important to only use rebase on a local branch that we're working on individually.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGit rebase can be a very powerful tool when working with numerous people and branches, if used correctly it allows everyone to view a very clean commit history and track what commits fixed given defects or whether or not a commit was included in a release. However, it’s critical to understand how it works and the risks that come with it since it’s a destructive operation. If done so correctly, it can result in a very fluid and effective workflow.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"f2c09be69043e44351a8d09c6607c02f","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},"2d9a93c55ad34555924f3db7927ef884":{"__typename":"KanbanProject","id":"2d9a93c55ad34555924f3db7927ef884","description":"Contribute entries to Codecademy Docs!","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":false,"published":true,"slug":"contributing-to-the-codecademy-docs-repository","title":"Contributing to the Codecademy Docs Repository","time":0,"type":"kanban_project","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"progress":{"__typename":"KanbanProjectProgressSummary","content_item_id":"2d9a93c55ad34555924f3db7927ef884","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null,"type":"kanban_project","state":{"__typename":"Kanban","to_do":null,"done":null,"in_progress":null}},"kanbanProjectInformation":{"__typename":"KanbanProjectInformation","longOverview":"### Codecademy Entry\nIn this project, you will create and submit an entry to [Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs) on a chosen topic.\n\n### Example Entry\n\nHere is an example of a Codecademy Docs entry: [hashmaps in Java](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/hashmap)\n\n### Objectives\n\n- Clone the Codecademy Docs Repository onto your local machine.\n- Create an entry in Markdown on your local machine.\n- Create a pull request to add your entry to Codecademy Docs.\n- Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).\n- Revise your entry based on the feedback of the members of the Codecademy Content Team.\n\n### Prerequisites\n- GitHub\n- Reasonable understanding of [Markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/markdown)\n\n\n","resources":"- [How to Contribute to Codecademy Docs](https://dev.to/codecademy/how-to-contribute-to-codecademy-docs-1a77)\n- [Markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/markdown)\n- [GitHub official docs](https://docs.github.com/en)\n- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)","setupInstructions":"To contribute to Codecademy Docs, you will need a copy of the Codecademy Docs Repository on your local machine.

Displaying and sharing code is easy. Users can create profiles to save interesting codebases, follow other users, and host their code. We'll discuss how to round out a GitHub profile and how to be engaged in all that the community has to offer!\n\n## Github Profiles\n\nWith GitHub profiles, users can follow other users and see what they work on in their careers. A well-rounded GitHub profile will not only look good to recruiters but boost reputability when we want to make contributions to open source projects.\n\nA good GitHub profile will have several different projects, ideally with different concepts driving each project. Each project should have a well-written `README` document. This shows that the user can communicate their work with other developers through good code documentation.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/github-profile.svg\" alt=\"A diagram imitation of a GitHub profile, which includes the user photo, different projects stored in different repositories called Code Art, JavaScript Tools, and Personal Website. At the bottom, there is a contribution counter to show how often the user works on their code.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnother thing that suggests a well-rounded GitHub profile would be a filled-out activity tracker that displays how many contributions the user makes daily, whether to their own projects or community ones. \n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4a2d448b710016ffc299\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4cc9448b710016ffc2a2\" /\u003e\n\n## Exploring Code on GitHub\n\nA great way to find inspiration for your projects is to use GitHub's search feature. You can search for specific companies, developers, and even projects. For instance, you can easily search for projects relating to a Discord chatbot and then choose the target language, like C#. If you want to contribute to a Discord bot built-in C# or grab some code to get yourself started on a chatbot, you can! \n\nAnother great place to look for projects pertaining to certain topics is the [GitHub Topics page](https://github.com/topics). Here, projects are grouped by topics like Arduino projects and algorithms.\n\nEven if you don't know what to look for, [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) will use existing projects in your GitHub profile to automatically find other projects you might be interested in. And, to see what other developers are currently interested in, you can check out [what's trending](https://github.com/trending) in the GitHub community!\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/github-trending-page.png\" alt=\"The image shows GitHub's trending page, full of recent popular projects from around the world.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4b931c625a00136c0888\" /\u003e\n\n## Open Source Projects On GitHub\n\nOpen source projects have their code open to the public and usually take code submissions from the developer community. For instance, NASA, Facebook, and Google all use GitHub for open-source projects. That means developers outside of those organizations volunteer to help with bug fixes and experiment on new features.\n\nWhile a company or developer might not want all of their projects to be open source, many big companies maintain open-source projects to stay in touch with the wider developer community and generate user interest. Google has many repositories where the broader community collaborates:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/google-open-source.png\" alt=\"Google's almost 2000 open repositories. At the top of the Google organization's page, the description says Google hearts Open Source.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnother example is Facebook has a repository named [Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly) which is used internally and has over 10,000 commits from developers from all over the world. That means that anyone who has made a commit to Folly can technically say they've helped add on to a project being used by Facebook.\n\nMaking contributions to open-source projects is a great way to grow your skill and experience. To contribute, you can start at any repository's issues page, where bugs and potential new features are listed.  Then, you can fork the repository to work on a specific issue and eventually make a pull request.\n\nYou can take a look at [these current open discussions in the Folly repository](https://github.com/facebook/folly/issues).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b489a22ca920017cc1624\" /\u003e\n\nNow that you know more about the GitHub community, feel free to start building up your profile by creating your own projects! You can also start exploring GitHub for other projects that you can fork or star. As you gain more experience, start looking at issues in projects and start fixing them!\n\n\n\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"cc6b56e2110a38780797c9bc702b5b20","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},"e684b918f7c2bc76f9c93971ac1112a4":{"__typename":"Article","id":"e684b918f7c2bc76f9c93971ac1112a4","description":"This article links to a project to complete in a public GitHub repository.

You can use the command line to directly make a pull request:\n\n```\ngh pr create\n```\n\nFollow the prompts and add the proper title and description for the pull request. Mention the id of the issue in the description following `#[id]` format so that GitHub automatically links the pull request to the issue. The following is an example description: \n\n\u003e This pull request imports the random library in magic8.py. Once merged, this resolves #1.\n\nTo check if this actually worked, you can check that the new pull request appears under the Pull Requests tab. Also, observe the state of the issue and see that the issue is now linked to the pull request. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-cli/github-cli-linked-pull-request-to-issue.png\" alt=\"On the GitHub web UI, we now see that the issue we created we linked to the new pull request that we created from the terminal.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAssuming that your pull request is good to go, you can merge your pull request using the following GitHub CLI command:\n\n```\ngh pr merge\n```\n\nOnce the pull request is merged, check back the status of the issues and notice that the issue is now closed and no longer listed under the open issues: \n\n```\ngh issue status\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWell done! You've now successfully used terminal commands to interact with GitHub APIs. GitHub terminal commands streamline code development as they enable developers to integrate a repository's pull requests and issues into terminal commands and bash scripts. GitHub CLI is a powerful and convenient tool!\n\nWant to learn more about terminal commands?

This is a built-in GitHub tracking tool for all the bugs, errors, and potential small feature changes for the project living inside the repository. In one view, collaborators of the repository can see what needs to be worked on (open issues) as well as which tasks were resolved (closed issues). Take a look at the [Codecademy docs Issue board](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/issues):\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/issues-board-docs.png\" alt=\"The image shows a board of about 10-15 tasks that each have a title, a user associated, and multiple labels that indicate language or type of issue.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe issue board acts as a forum for all the collaborators of the repository. In some instances, issue boards are public and users of a project can submit and discuss bugs they've encountered.\n\n#### Labels\nTo help organize issues when more and more pop up in a project, we can use labels. `bug` and `feature` are common labels used to differentiate between errors and new features. In the Codecademy Docs repo Issue board earlier, we could see labels such as `Good first issue`, if a suggested entry to Docs is `new` or an `edit`, and what language the entry should be in, like `C#` or `Java`. Labels help us toggle between different types of issues at a glance and have short names.\n\n#### Creating an Issue\nTo create an Issue, we can click the `New Issue` button on top of the Issues board. This will take us to a new page where to set the title and content of the issue. \n\nIssues are a bit like pull requests in that we want to keep the title specific but to the point. For descriptions, repositories often have their own guidelines (just like pull requests do) for including details. For example, if the issue is related to a bug, we should include the error message in the description. Check out a complete issue from the Facebook Folly repository:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/completed-issue.png\" alt=\"An issue with a title Typedef redefinition #1658. The user included in the description the error message they encountered. The history shows where else this issue was mentioned and closed and reopened.\"\u003e\n\nOnce the issue is posted and now open, collaborators and other GitHub users can add to the discussion and reference this issue by the `#` in other issues and pull requests.\n\n## GitHub Project Management\n\nGitHub projects is a beta feature (as of late 2021) for project management. While other project management tools exist, like JIRA or even handwritten post-its, GitHub projects allow direct integration within the repository, letting developers stay within the same ecosystem. We can also create automated project boards that trigger the status of issues and pull requests. And… it's completely free!\n\nTo try out projects, we can select the `New Project` option after clicking the `+` button on the upper right side of the GitHub dashboard. In most cases, projects are linked to repositories, which already have existing issues and pull requests, but in other cases, projects can be standalone.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/new-project.png\" alt=\"The dropdown menu from the top right of the GitHub dashboard, which shows the New Project option.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nAfter filling out the name and description of the new project, a drop-down will appear asking what Project template we want to use. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/project-types.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"The different project types include None, Basic kanban, Automated kanban, Automated kanban with reviews, and Bug triage.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe options range from different types of Kanban boards that can host issues and pull requests to a Bug Triage, which gives details into which bugs are high priority, low priority, or need further investigation. Once the board is created, we will [add issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board) to it.\n\nAn example of a laid-out GitHub project board is [Github's own public roadmap project](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/1), shown next. This is an example of a Project with no repository, as a roadmap can be used for organizational purposes.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/github-project-board.png\" alt=\"The GitHub public roadmap that includes major issues (each with labels) for each quarter.\"\u003e\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we learned about two GitHub features that can come in handy for teams: issues and projects.  We can use GitHub issues to keep track of tasks that need to be worked on. Those issues can then be referenced in pull requests, comments, or projects. GitHub projects are an even newer feature for project management purposes and can be linked to repositories. We can choose from a variety of different board types to organize tasks.\n\nWe encourage you to try these out if you want to incorporate project management into your GitHub experience!\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"59213c16722bda2f3f29cdbf5042aa19","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},"a6c6ded77782d171d072c93332650fdf":{"__typename":"Article","id":"a6c6ded77782d171d072c93332650fdf","description":"In this article, you'll learn about how GitHub Actions streamline the development workflow.

Or have you ever worked in a team where everyone promised the final version would work fine but ended up [erroring]? This is called the \"works on my machine\" syndrome in software development. \n\nNow imagine we could configure your [GitHub] repository to automatically run tests to verify the functionality of the codebase after each code change. Well… we can, using **GitHub Actions**!\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\n[GitHub Actions] is a powerful, advanced GitHub feature that enables users to define custom and automated workflows triggered on various types of events such as [pushing code] or [creating a pull request]. The workflows execute inside a temporary container running in GitHub infrastructure.\n\n## Tutorial: add automated testing to a repository\n\nIn this tutorial project, you will use GitHub Actions to integrate automatic unit tests to a repository. You will fork a public repository that contains a sample bank application and add a configuration to trigger (already written) unit tests in the repository. Try your best to follow along!\n\n### Bank account application\n\nThe [Bank Account repository] contains Python Flask application code to manage the balance of an imaginary checking account. To understand this tutorial, you don't need extensive Python knowledge or experience with the Flask framework. If you're curious though, the `README.md` file includes more details about the code. \n\n### Run tests on code push\n\nNow that we know what GitHub Actions are and how they enhance development workflows, let's continue by adding an action to a repository. Start by forking and then cloning [Codecademy's Bank Account repository]. Once you clone your forked copy of the repository from your GitHub account onto your local computer, create a new branch: \n\n```shell\ngit checkout -b \"add-auto-tests\"\n```\n\nIn your new branch, create a new directory and name it `.github`. Note that the dot in the beginning of the directory name is important. This is a keyword known to GitHub. \n\nThen create another directory inside the `.github` directory and name it `workflows`. GitHub looks for the definitions of GitHub Actions inside this directory. \n\nCreate a new `.yaml` file inside the directory. Let's name it `unittests.yaml` and paste the following content inside the file. Note that the indentation and spacing are important. \n\n```bash\nname: Continuous Integration\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Set up Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.10.0\n          architecture: x64\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: pip install -r requirements.txt \n      - name: Run Tests\n        run: python -m pytest\n```\n\nThe file introduces a new GitHub Action named `Continuous Integration` that is triggered on `push`, meaning that everytime a developer pushes a code to a branch where this file exists. The action then runs the following steps in the order of their definition on an `ubuntu-latest` container:\n\n1. Check out to the current Git branch.\n2. Set up Python on the container.\n3. Install the Python dependencies of the Bank Account app defined in `requirements.txt`.\n4. Run the unit tests using Pytest.\n\nAdd and commit your changes, then push the branch out to your remote repository on your GitHub account: \n\n```shell\ngit add . \ngit commit -a -m \"added a GitHub action to run unit tests automatically on code push\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin \"add-auto-tests\"\n```\n\nNow open your repository in a browser and navigate under the Actions tab. You should see a new workflow started a few seconds ago:\n\n![\"A new workflow being run in the GitHub Actions tab.\"]\n\nClick on the workflow to show the details. The logs for every individual step are available: \n\n![\"Workflow details showing the log for every step taken in the GitHub action.\"]\n\nClick through the steps to read the logs. Once the workflow finishes, you will see a green checkmark. If any of the unit tests fail, the workflow fails and you will see an email notification. You can try that by intentionally breaking one of the tests and pushing your code to your branch. \n\n### Run tests on pull request creation \n\nNow let`s make this GitHub Action workflow also run the tests when creating a new pull request. \n\nOpen `unittests.yaml` file and update the array of triggers to add `pull_request`:\n\n```shell\non: [push, pull_request]\n```\n\nCommit and push your change to the branch. Notice that an instance of a container to run the tests will begin under the Actions tab just like before. But now, create a pull request from the `add-auto-tests` branch to your `main` branch (on your own repository). The GitHub action will then run as an automated check and ensure the unit tests pass. If the action fails, the pull request cannot be merged. \n\n![\"All GitHub actions have run and passed the pull request checks.\"]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGitHub Actions enable automated workflows for developers. In this tutorial, we were able to add automated testing to a repository, which ensures quality control over the code. We encourage you to explore more GitHub Actions that can be configured to run other types of automation: docker builds, project compilation, tagging, releasing, and more!","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"a6c6ded77782d171d072c93332650fdf","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}}}},"tracks":{"byId":{"a8ab218d5950c29861635cc0bf12fd13":{"__typename":"Track","id":"a8ab218d5950c29861635cc0bf12fd13","title":"Learn Git \u0026 GitHub","slug":"learn-git","container_type":"Track","categories":[{"__typename":"Category","slug":"technical-recruiter","title":"Technical Recruiter","type":"role"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"web-development","title":"Web Development","type":"subject"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"open-source","title":"Open Source","type":"subject"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"computer-science","title":"Computer Science","type":"subject"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"developer-tools","title":"Developer Tools","type":"subject"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"bash","title":"Bash/Shell","type":"language"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"sales-engineer","title":"Sales Engineer","type":"role"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"git-hub","title":"GitHub","type":"skill"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"git","title":"Git","type":"skill"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"computer-science-domain","title":"Computer Science Domain","type":"domain"}],"created_at":"2018-04-30T17:32:32Z","last_modified_at":"2024-02-21T21:31:14Z","published":true,"completion_message":"","short_description":"Use our beginner friendly Git course to integrate Git and GitHub and manage versions of your projects using Git branches.

With the recent creation of GitHub Copilot, a cutting-edge AI-driven coding assistant, developers can now code better innovations more easily and quickly than ever before. To show-off just how easy Copilot can make programming, this project will walk through crafting a factorial calculator. [Factorials](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) serve as a great example of a simple problem that has many applications in statistics and algorithm design, such as counting the many arrangements of a group of objects. Even if it has been decades since your last statistics class, this functionality can still be easily built by leaving the specifics of these mathematical properties to Copilot. \n\n  \n\n### Setting Up GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nBefore diving into this new way of coding, it’s crucial to be properly set up. For an in-depth guide on setting up Visual Studio Code, we recommend reviewing our [GitHub Copilot setup article](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/intro-to-github-copilot/articles/setting-up-git-hub-copilot). For those more familiar with the process, here is a high-level overview of what is needed to follow along with this project: \n\n  \n\n1. **GitHub Account:** If you don’t have one, sign up [here](https://github.com/). \n\n2. **GitHub Copilot Subscription:** Copilot requires a subscription to use. This can be purchased with the option of a free trial [here](https://github.com/features/copilot). \n\n3. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** While Copilot can work in a variety of code editors, it integrates best with VSCode. Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). \n\n4. **GitHub Copilot Extension:** Once you're in VSCode, head over to the left extensions sidebar and search for \"GitHub Copilot\". Install this official extension and log in to your GitHub account when prompted. \n\n  \n\n### Working with GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nWith the setup complete, the easiest way to get started with Copilot is just to start typing away. While you code as usual, Copilot will make suggestions to speed up your development and proactively prevent errors. More precisely, this loop looks like this: \n\n  \n\n1. **Start Typing:** As you begin typing in VSCode, Copilot will automatically provide suggestions. \n\n2. **Accept Suggestions:** Press \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e to accept the auto-completion if Copilot correctly understood your intention. \n\n3. **Ask Copilot:** If you're unsure about how to implement the next feature, just write a comment describing the problem in a comment, such as `// How do I...`. Copilot will then attempt to give you the answer as another code suggestion in your text editor. \n\n4. **Continue Coding:** Keep the momentum going, coding the functions easiest to implement for you, and letting Copilot take the lead when feeling stuck. \n\n  \n\n### Having Copilot Write the Factorial Function \n\n  \n\nNow that we know the workflow of working with GitHub Copilot, let’s kick things off with the backbone of our calculator: the factorial function. \n\n  \n\nFactorials are easy to calculate. They are the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the given number. For example, the factorial of five, written as `5!`, is `5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`.  \n\n  \n\nTo get started, create a new Python file called `factorial_calculator.py`. Then, have GitHub Copilot help write the function to calculate the factorial: \n\n  \n\n1. Start by typing `def factorial(n):` in your Python file. \n\n2. GitHub Copilot should automatically suggest code similar to the following: \n\n```python \ndef factorial(n): \n    if n == 0: \n        return 1 \n    else: \n        return n * factorial(n-1) \n``` \n\n3. Press \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e to accept the suggestion. \n\n  \n\nVoila! In no time at all, you've got your function! \n\n  \n\nDo keep in mind that while the above example is the most common way to calculate a factorial, it is also possible for Copilot to recommend a different solution entirely. For example, instead of recursively multiplying each integer, a loop could be used to calculate the factorial iteratively. This may offer better performance in certain cases and highlights why general technical knowledge is still important even when leaving the coding to Copilot. \n\n  \n\n### Prompting Copilot to Build User Input for the Function \n\n  \n\nUser input is a great example of boilerplate code that is often written very similarly regardless of the application. With Copilot, not only is this precious time saved for the programmer, but edge cases that may be glossed over until they cause errors can be proactively prevented. To start making the calculator interactive: \n\n  \n\n1. Begin by typing `def get_factorial_input():`. \n\n2. Wait for Copilot's suggestion, which should be along the lines of: \n\n```python \ndef get_factorial_input(): \n    \"\"\" \n    Prompts the user for a non-negative integer and returns it. \n    Keeps prompting until a valid non-negative integer is provided. \n    \"\"\" \n    while True: \n        try: \n            # Get input from the user \n            num = int(input(\"Enter a non-negative integer for factorial computation: \")) \n\n            # Check if the number is non-negative \n            if num \u003e= 0: \n                return num \n            else: \n                print(\"Please enter a non-negative integer.\") \n        except ValueError: \n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\") \n``` \n\n3. Accept the suggestion by pressing \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e. \n\n  \n\nNow, combine the two functions by asking the user for input and then calculating the factorial: \n\n```python \nnumber = get_factorial_input() \nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}\") \n``` \n\n  \n\nAnd just like that, not only has input been built for calculating factorials, but an edge case that may not have crossed the mind of most programmers has also been solved! This is the power of GitHub Copilot! Faster software development with fewer errors from having analyzed millions of lines of code.  \n\n  \n\n### Write Tests for the Code with Copilot \n\n  \n\nAs we just saw, there may be many surprise use cases for our code. To ensure that our code works as expected, we can ask Copilot to write some common test cases for us. \n\n  \n\n1. Start with `def test_factorial():`. \n\n2. Copilot might suggest: \n\n```python \ndef test_factorial(): \n    assert factorial(5) == 120 \n    assert factorial(0) == 1 \n    assert factorial(7) == 5040 \n    print(\"All tests passed!\") \n``` \n\n3. Accept the suggestion and run the tests with `test_factorial()`. \n\n  \n\nIt is important to verify that these test cases work as expected. While Copilot will likely get many things right, there is a chance that it may misinterpret the intended functionality of the program. This again highlights that while Copilot can very much improve the speed, and possibly the quality, of software developers, it cannot replace them. A human will always be required to verify that the code matches the real-world goals it was originally set out to achieve. \n\n  \n\n### Continuing Your Programming Journey with Copilot \n\n  \n\nGitHub Copilot isn't just a tool; it's a revolution in how people develop software. It seamlessly integrates AI into the programmer's workflow, making coding more accessible and efficient. By following this guide, not only did you craft a nifty factorial calculator, but you also took a leap into the future of coding. Use it well, and happy programming!

We will break down a couple that are powerful for daily tasks.\n\n### Git stash\n\nLet's say you're working on experimental code on a fresh branch and realize that you forgot to add something to a previous commit in order to continue your work. In order to go to a different branch, one must always be at a clean commit point. In this case you don't want to commit your experimental code since it's not ready but you also don't want to lose all the code you've been working on.\n\nA good way to handle this is by using `git stash`, which allows you to get back to a clean commit point with a synchronized working tree, and avoid losing your local changes in the process. You're \"stashing\" your local work temporarily in order to update a previous commit and later on retrieve your work.\n\nThe flow when using `git stash` might look something like this:\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-stash-pop-diagram.svg\" alt=\"In this diagram, a coworker asks the programmer if they can work on something else while they have their current code open. Git stash allows their current code to be stashed as they finish the other update. Git stash pop puts the code changes back into the working directory.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile working on a file, you find a small bug in a separate file from a previous commit that needs to be fixed before you continue. \n\n```\n$ git stash\n```\n\nRunning the command above will store your work temporarily for later use in a hidden directory.\n\nAt this point, you can switch branches and do work elsewhere.\n\nOnce the bug is fixed, you want to retrieve the code you were working on previously, you can \"pop\" the work that was stored when you used `git stash`. \n\n```\n$ git stash pop\n```\n\nFrom here, you can continue your work and commit it when ready.\n\nComing up we have a short video demo’ing this in action.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gL3Safgahk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Git log\n\nAt this point you might be familiar with the command `git log`, which allows you to view the commit history of the branch you currently have checked out:\n\n![Git Log output shows recent commit history](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log.png)\n\nThere are other ways you can use `git log` in order to view recorded changes. Here are a few examples:\n\n- `git log --oneline` shows the list of commits in one line format.\n\n![Git Log online output shows recent commit history all in one line](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-oneline-2.png)\n\n- `git log -S \"keyword\"` displays a list of commits where the number of occurrences of the keyword changes within at least one file via addition, deletion, or modification. In the screenshot below, we use `git log -S \"Add\"` to find any commits where the number of occurrences of \"Add\" within a file changes.\n\n![The output of `git log -S \"Add\"` finds a commit where the number of occurrences of \"Add\" changes within a file.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-S.png)\n\n- `git log --oneline --graph` - `--graph` Displays a visual representation of how the branches and commits were created in order to help you make sense of your repository history. When used alone, the description can be very lengthy, so you can combine the command with `--oneline` in order to shorten the description.\n\n![Git log --online --graph outputs a graphical representation of commits, showing where branches were created earlier and merged.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-oneline-graph.png)\n\n## Git commit amend\n\nGit’s `--amend` flag is extremely useful when updating a commit, it allows you to correct mistakes and edit commits easily instead of creating a completely new one. \n\nLet's say you finish working on a lengthy feature and everything seems to be working fine so you commit your work. Shortly after, you realize you missed a few semicolons in one of your functions. You could technically create a new commit, but ideally, you want to keep all commits specific, clean, and succinct. To avoid creating a new one, you could create your changes, stage them with `git add` and then type the command `git commit --amend` to update your previous commit. \n\nIt's important to note that although it seems like `--amend` is simply updating the commit, what Git actually does is replace the whole previous commit. For this reason, when you execute the command `git commit --amend`, your terminal editor asks  you to update your commit message:\n\n![git-amend](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-commit-amend.png)\n\nHowever, if you want to keep the same commit message, you can simply add the flag `--no-edit`:\n\n```\n$ git commit --amend --no-edit\n```\n\n## Git alias commands\nWhen grouping commands together, you can end up writing very long lines of Git commands in the terminal such as:\n\n```\n$ git log --pretty=format:\"%h %s\" --graph\n```\n\nFortunately, Git offers a helpful feature that can make your Git experience simpler, easier, and more familiar: aliases.\n\nIf you have a set of commands that you use regularly and want to save some time from typing them, you can easily set up an alias for each command using Git config.\n\nBelow are a couple of examples:\n\n\n```\n$ git config --global alias.co \"checkout\"\n$ git config --global alias.br \"branch\"\n$ git config --global alias.glop \"log --pretty=format:\"%h %s\" --graph\"\n```\n\nOnce the aliases are configured, next time you want to check out to another branch you could type the command:\n\n```\n$ git co example_branch\n```\n\nInstead of:\n\n```\n$ git checkout example_branch\n```\n\nUsing Git aliases can create a much more fluid and efficient workflow experience when using Git. By getting creative with your aliases, you're able to wrap a sequence of Git commands into one in order to save time and effort.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"0ddf89185869cb4e33b94bdd15cb84c3","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Lesson","id":"41dac95eab590031fdfd96b778b43fdd","description":"Learn about a few different commands to switch between different versions of a Git project and when to use them.

When working on a project, things can scale rather quickly. Following a specific workflow allows the project to move in more orderly way.\n\nRemember that Git is defined as a version control system that's maintained on your local system. It helps you manage and record your source code history. GitHub, on the other hand, is a hosting service for repositories. Simply put, Git is the tool and GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.\n\nIn this lesson we'll take a look at the basic workflow used with GitHub, which goes like this:\n\n1. Create a branch\n2. Commit changes\n3. Create a pull request\n4. Review pull request\n5. Merge and delete branch\n\nBy sticking to that workflow, team members are able to isolate their work and avoid any conflicting code from being merged.

With Git, each teammate can create their own branch off of the main project in order to work on bug-fixes, new features, experimental code, etc. \n\nA branch is essentially a divergence from the main project. ​​When you branch out, git is essentially making a new state of your current code, upon which you can work, without affecting the important main state of the code. One can create as many branches as they wish and even create branches off of other branches.\n\nBy using separate branches, the main project remains intact and unaffected before the changes are reviewed and  merged into the project. \n\nEach repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, is called `main`. The `main` branch is usually the working version of a project and contains the production code, so it's very important to only merge clean and correct code into it!\n\nWhen someone wants to create a new feature, fix a bug, or just experiment, they should always create their own branch with a descriptive name. \n\nEach team will adopt their own best practices when working together and figuring out naming conventions. For example, the branch name `carlos_feature_dashboard_notifications` includes the author, branch type, and short branch description. Other teams may pick branch names to correspond to ticket numbers from their project management tool.\n","instructions":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"79be33a752d545876fbbafbb4d806781","sourceId":null,"title":"Adding and Committing Changes ","slug":"adding-and-committing-changes","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2021-10-28T18:59:17Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"container_type":"static-web","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2022-01-05T22:11:24Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"61d6178f5a19e700169a8867","slug":"blank-workspace","type":"static-web"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.3},"components":[{"__typename":"LayoutImage","id":"61d49fc30276cb000f76a238","type":"Image","image_url":"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-flow/github-flow-commit-changes.svg","alt_text":"commit changes"},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"617af4dc4380400012042d9d","type":"Narrative","content":"Let's assume you were recently assigned to a team to develop a feature for an app. You clone (download) the entire app repository from GitHub, create a new branch from the `main` branch for your feature, and begin coding a new file in your local Git environment. \n\nAfter testing your code and ensuring that everything is running correctly, it's time to commit the changes and push them to the remote repository!\n\nAs a refresher, the `git commit` command records changes to one or more files in your branch, assigning the commit a unique ID that identifies who created the changes, what changes were made, and _when_ the changes were committed.\n\nAdd a commit message describing your work and finally, push the commit to the remote GitHub repository.","instructions":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"c6b97bb86536d9169a7866a4b47e45c9","sourceId":null,"title":"Creating a Pull Request","slug":"creating-a-pull-request","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2021-10-28T19:09:51Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"container_type":"static-web","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2022-01-04T19:33:13Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"61d5d47b29505800258d8431","slug":"blank-workspace","type":"static-web"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.566667},"components":[{"__typename":"LayoutImage","id":"61d4a0f9295058001c8d8360","type":"Image","image_url":"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-flow/github-flow-open-pull-request.svg","alt_text":"open pull request"},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"617af5b485c821000ea06129","type":"Narrative","content":"At this point, your work is ready to be reviewed before it's integrated into the official project.

Specifically, we'll walk through creating your personal GitHub account, setting up Git on your computer, starting your first Git repository, and connecting that repository to a GitHub repository.\n\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you've completed the lessons on \u003ca href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLearn the Command Line\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLearn Git\u003c/a\u003e. Now, prepare to use those skills on your personal computer! If some steps in this tutorial are confusing, have no fear; it will all come together by the end.\n\n\n## What are Git and GitHub?\n\n\nThis tutorial refers to Git and GitHub repeatedly. *Git* is a widely-used version control system used to manage code. Git allows you to save drafts of your code so that you can look back at previous versions and potentially undo complicated errors. A project managed with Git is called a *Git repository*. \n\n\n*GitHub* is a popular hosting service for Git repositories. GitHub allows you to store your local Git repositories in the cloud. With GitHub, you can backup your personal files, share your code, and collaborate with others.\n\n\nIn short, GitHub is a tool for working with Git. There are other services to host Git repositories, but GitHub is a trusted, free service used by organizations across the world, big and small.\n\n\n## Create a GitHub Account\n\n\nTo use GitHub, you will need a GitHub account.\n\n\nIn your own browser:\n\n\n1. Open a new browser tab\n2. Navigate to \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://github.com/\u003c/a\u003e \n3. Create an account\n\n\nIf you already have a GitHub account, continue to the next exercise.\n\n\nAfter you sign up, you will receive a verification e-mail. Be sure to verify your e-mail address to GitHub by following the instructions in that e-mail.\n\n\n## Git Setup for Mac and Windows\n\n\nNext, we will set up Git on your personal computer. Follow the instructions for your operating system.\n\n\n### Mac users:\n\n\n1\\. Launch the **_Terminal_** application. You can find it in __/Applications/Utilities/__. You can also use the **_Spotlight_** search tool (the little magnifying glass in the top right of your screen) to search for **_Terminal_**. Once **_Spotlight_** locates it, click on the result that says **_Terminal_**.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n2\\. When **_Terminal_** opens, type in `git` and press enter.\n \n3\\. If you don't already have Git installed, a dialog will appear saying that \"The 'git' command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?\" Click \"Install\".\n\n![macInstall](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_prompt.png)\n\nThen click \"Agree to the Terms of Service\" when requested.\n\n![macAgree](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_terms.png)\n\n4\\. When the download finishes, the installer will go away on its own signifying that Git is now installed! Click \"Done\" to finish the installation process.\n\n![macDone](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_finished.png)\n\n\nNow skip down to the \"Final Setup\" section below to finish setting up.\n\n\n### Windows users:\n\n\nThis portion of the guide assumes you have already installed a program called Git Bash which allows us access to Git on Windows. If you have not installed Git Bash, please refer to the previous tutorial on Command Line Interface (CLI) Setup and follow the instructions for installing Git Bash on Windows. Once you complete that you can continue with this guide.\n\n1\\. Open the Start menu and search for the app, git bash. You should see ‘Git Bash Desktop app’ appear. Press Enter or click on the Git Bash icon to open the app.\n\n![gitBashOpen](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_start.png)\n\nA new window will open that looks like this:\n\n![gitBashShell](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_shell_edited.png)\n\nThis window is our CLI, where we will use our Git commands.\n\n2\\. If you want to make sure that Git is installed, run `git --version` in the CLI. You should see a response that gives you the version of Git installed. It will look like this:\n\n![gitVersion](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_test_edited.png)\n\nGit can now be used in the Git Bash app!\n\nContinue on to finish setting up.\n\n\n### Final Setup\n\n\n1. Navigate to GitHub's articles on setting up your \u003ca href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGit username\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eemail\u003c/a\u003e and follow the instructions for each using Git Bash. \n2. GitHub offers two authentication options, HTTPS and SSH, to keep your work secure. This is a security measure that prevents anyone who isn't authorized from making changes to your GitHub repository. In this article, we will use HTTPS. \n    * To authenticate yourself in the terminal, you will need to generate a _Personal Access Token_ on GitHub. Navigate to GitHub's article on [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) and follow the instructions for creating a classic token. Be sure to check the box that grants the token `repo` scope \u0026mdash; this will allow you to write to the repository from the terminal on your machine.\n    * Once you get the token, make sure to copy it or keep the page open \u0026mdash; you will not be able to view the token again once you navigate away from the page and you'll need it later in the instructions!\n\n\n## Try It Out!\n\n\nNow you have everything you need to practice your Git skills on your local computer. Take a moment to run the commands below to initialize a Git repository. We will use this Git repository again later in this tutorial so make sure you complete these steps exactly as described.\n\n\n1. `mkdir git_practice` to make a new directory to practice.\n2. `cd git_practice` to make the new directory your working directory.\n3. `git init` to turn the current, empty directory into a fresh Git repository.\n4. `echo \"Hello Git and GitHub\" \u003e\u003e README.txt` to create a new README file (more on this later) with some sample text.\n5. `git add README.txt` to add the new file to the Git staging area.\n6. `git commit -m \"First commit\"` to make your first commit with the new README file.\n\n\n## Your First Remote Repository on GitHub\n\n\nFinally, we'll create a repository on GitHub and then link it to a local repository on your computer. This allows you to backup your work constantly and safely, so you never need to worry about losing your work again!\n\n\nNow, let's connect our local Git repository to GitHub.\n\n\n### Instructions\n\n\n1\\. In your Command Line Interface, make sure your current working directory is your new Git repository. Navigate there if not.\n\n\n2\\. Check the status of which files and folders are new or have been edited. There should be no files modified.\n\n\n```\n$ git status\n```\n\n\n3\\. On GitHub, create a new repository by clicking the __New repository__ button on the home page. \n![newRepository](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_button.svg)\n\n4\\. On the new repository page, give your repository a name. It's not necessary, but it would be convenient to name it the same as the directory, **git_practice**. After naming the repository, click __Create repository__.\n![createRepository](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_creation.svg)\n\n\n5\\. After creating a repository, GitHub displays the repository page. At the top of the page, make sure \"HTTPS\" is selected.\n![githubHttps](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_https.svg)\n\n\n6\\.The repository is empty, so it's time to connect it to your existing work. Copy the Git commands on the GitHub page, under the title \"...or push an existing repository from the command line\", and paste them into your Command Line Interface. Running these commands will add a remote repository, and then push your local repository to the remote repository. \n\nWhen asked for a username and password, type in your GitHub username as the username and paste your personal access token as the password, pressing \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e (or \u003ckbd\u003ereturn\u003c/kbd\u003e) after each. Don't be alarmed if you can't see the characters you are typing, they are intentionally hidden as a security measure.\n![githubCommands](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_push.svg)\n\n\n7\\. Once your Command Line Interface reports that the push is complete, refresh the page on GitHub. You should now see the text you wrote earlier in the README file, \"Hello Git and GitHub.\"\n\n\nGitHub automatically displays the contents of a file named **README.txt** if it exists in the repository. The README file is the perfect place to write a description of your project.\n\n\nThere you have it! Your first GitHub repository, linked to your local Git repository. You've taken some huge leaps, so be proud! Now you can use your knowledge of Git to track progress on your local computer and push that progress to GitHub whenever you want. You can rest easy knowing that each step of your progress is safely stored in GitHub.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"74bb71f3f3d5998245e9bbef934502d9","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"a6c65e4516831c607a89421e8e12492e","description":"Learn how to sign up for a GitHub account and share your code","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"what-is-github","title":"What is GitHub?","time":10,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What is GitHub?\n\nOne of the best ways to share what you've been learning with other people is to put your code on GitHub. GitHub is both a website and a service that facilitates software development by allowing you to store your code in containers, called _repositories_, and by tracking changes made to your code. In addition, it offers a hosting service and tools to build, test, and deploy code. \n\nGitHub uses [Git, a version-control development tool]( https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git), to manage your projects by tracking changes to files and allowing multiple people to work on the same project. Although both GitHub and Git have similar names, GitHub is a service, while Git is a development tool that can be used by you outside of and without GitHub. \n\n## Why is GitHub important?\n\nThere are many reasons why knowing about GitHub is important for your personal growth as a developer. A large part of the appeal of Github is the access it grants developers to the massive community of developers around the world who openly share their code, projects, and software development tools with each other. Therefore, if you want to continue working on your Git skills, creating your programming portfolio, or finding work, GitHub can help.  \n\n## How to Sign Up for an Account\n\nNow that you're aware of GitHub's benefits, you probably want to sign up for an account and try it out yourself. First, navigate to the home page of the GitHub website, [https://github.com](https://github.com). \n\nYou can click on the **Sign Up** button in the upper right corner or fill out your email and click on **Sign up for GitHub**, as highlighted in this screenshot: \n\n![Home page of the GitHub website with the **Sign Up** buttons highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-1-signup.png)\n\nYou’ll be taken to a page asking you to fill out your email. If you did so on the home page, it will already be filled out for you. If it isn’t filled out, enter the email you wish to use. \n\n![GitHub prompting for email with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-2-email.png)\n\nPick an email that you're comfortable sharing with peers and potential hires. Because of the way Git works, it's important to note that your email can be exposed publicly when you make a pull request or merge in code to a repository, making it visible to anyone looking through your projects. When you sign up for a new GitHub account, your email address is hidden by default.  \n\nOnce you have an email entered, click on “continue.” GitHub will then ask you to create a password. Fill out a password for your new account. \n\n![GitHub prompting for password with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-3-password.png)\n\nWhen you click on “continue,” GitHub will then ask you for a username. Fill out the user name you would like to use (you may need to try a few times to find one that’s available). \n\n![GitHub prompting for user name with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/Image-4-username.png)\n\nLike with email addresses, when choosing a username, it's wise to choose one you wouldn't mind future employers or colleagues seeing. A combination of your first and last name, like `firstnamelastname`, or using initials, like `i_lastname`, are good because they make it easy to find you on GitHub or identify you when you make [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) or [reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). Remember, you're likely using this account to share or access code. \n\nAlso be aware that usernames are first come, first serve and may not be available if someone else already claimed the username. Additionally, usernames may only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens are not allowed at the beginning or end. \n\nAfter you click on “continue,” GitHub will prompt to ask if you want to receive product updates and announcements. Make your selection and click “continue,” again. GitHub will then prompt you to solve a puzzle to prove you’re a human being. Click on “Verify” to view the puzzle. \n\nOnce you submit the solution to the puzzle, a “Create Account” button will appear. Click on it and GitHub will prompt you for an 8-digit code. GitHub will send you the code to the email you entered earlier. Enter the code from the email and GitHub will create your account.  \n\n## Settings\n\nOnce your account is created, GitHub will ask a couple of questions to personalize your experience. Fill these out or click on the “skip personalization” link at the bottom of the page. \n\nYou should now see a personal dashboard with a section for your projects and some messages: \n\n![GitHub personal dashboard](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-5-dashboard.png)\n\nNow you have your own GitHub account! You can continue to customize your account by:\n\n+ [setting your email to private](https://github.blog/2017-04-11-private-emails-now-more-private/) \n\n+ [setting up two-factor authentication](https://github.blog/2013-09-03-two-factor-authentication/)\n\nThat's it; you now have your very own GitHub account. 🎉\n\n## Recap\n\nWith more people working remotely and with teams distributed across different countries and time zones, GitHub and Git can be valuable tools for collaborating on projects. You can also use GitHub to work on any file-based project, such as writing documentation. \n\nLet's review what you did in this article:\n\n+ Learned that GitHub is both a website and service for storing and sharing code\n+ Learned that GitHub uses Git to facilitate software development by tracking changes\n+ Created your own GitHub account\n+ Enabled security features like keeping your email private and turning on two-factor authentication\n\n## Going Further\n\nOnce you feel comfortable navigating GitHub, consider doing the following:\n\n+ [Add information about yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile) in your profile, including an avatar, bio, location, etc.\n+ [Set your status](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile#setting-a-status) in your profile to let people know what you're doing.\n+ If you feel comfortable enough with Git, you can take a look at [this article on GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), GitHub's hosting service that allows you to create a personal website, \"project site\", based on a repository to make your portfolio site.\n+ If you're interested in paid accounts, GitHub has a [pricing page](https://github.com/pricing) with various types of accounts and features you can look at.\n\nShow the world what you can do with your code!","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"a6c65e4516831c607a89421e8e12492e","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Quiz","id":"e228cb3d06c7bbe9909d54249e444d7a","description":"Practice what you've learned about GitHub Flow with the following quiz!","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":false,"published":true,"slug":"github-flow-quiz","title":"GitHub Flow","time":10,"type":"quiz","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"progress":{"__typename":"QuizProgressSummary","content_item_id":"e228cb3d06c7bbe9909d54249e444d7a","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T17:03:24+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T17:08:45+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T17:08:45+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":[{"__typename":"QuizResult","at":"1714064604160","correct":4,"total":10},{"__typename":"QuizResult","at":"1714064924999","correct":8,"total":10}],"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}},"total":10,"correct":8,"pct":80,"highest_pct":80,"passed":true,"passed_any":true,"taken":true,"type":"quiz","quiz_attempts":[{"__typename":"QuizAttempt","at":"1714064604160","correct":4,"passed":false,"percent":40,"total":10},{"__typename":"QuizAttempt","at":"1714064924999","correct":8,"passed":true,"percent":80,"total":10}]},"assessment_ids":["6197d3ef6cf8ac00228d381b","6197d45e3f4a5f0017ba756e","6197d4d03f4a5f0025ba74fa","6197d4617ff745000ece93fb","6197d462e97f910016ea6108","6197d462a84efb0016025e9f","6197d63396a1400025e36fa6","6197d636694a900012267506","6197d82fec2da200132a463a","6197d8d17ff7450021ce9402"],"assessments":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoice","id":"6197d3ef6cf8ac00228d381b","type":"multiple_choice","prompt":"What is the name of the starting branch when creating a new GitHub repository?","correct_answer":0,"answers":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`main`","reason":"Correct!

Invented by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004, Markdown provides a lightweight syntax to style any text document so that it can be converted to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) for viewing and publishing.\n\n## Differences between HTML and Markdown\n\nMarkdown translates to HTML, but Markdown is not a replacement for HTML. Markdown’s syntax can be converted to a small subset of HTML tags to do things like format text, add links, display images, and more. You can even incorporate HTML elements inside a Markdown document. To render Markdown in HTML, though, you would need a tool called a Markdown parser (more about this parser later on).\n\n## Benefits of Using Markdown\n\nWhy would you use Markdown? Compared to HTML, writing text in Markdown is much faster because the syntax is simpler. The [authors of Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) intended Markdown to be a language for writing styled text with syntax that is just as easy to read as it is to write. \n\nImagine that we are writing down some important text on a sheet of paper. If we wanted to emphasize the text we might underline it, twice even! Similarly, in Markdown, we could write:\n\n```\nTitle of My Document\n====================\n```\n\nNotice that we have plain text that has a row of equal signs (`=`) to produce a first-level header, also known as `\u003ch1\u003e`. On a webpage, the heading will display as such:\n\nTitle of My Document\n====================\n\nThe amount of `=`s don't matter so long as there's at least one and it goes under the text. \n\nFor text that's important, but not as important as a first-level heading, we might just underline it once. In code, we could use a row of hyphens (`-`), like so:\n\n```\nSub-Title of My Document\n------------------------\n```\n\nto produce a second-level header, also known as `\u003ch2\u003e`:\n\nSub-Title of My Document\n------------------------\n\nBoth examples are valid Markdown syntax. It is intuitive and normal for headings to be in either format. Alternatively, you can format headings using the `#` character. We'll show more examples of different headings, but for now, here's an example of valid syntax for a `\u003ch1\u003e` heading:\n\n```\n# Title of My Document\n```\n\nFurthermore, a Markdown document without any HTML tags can be published as is because its syntax is already made for easy viewing.  For example, the following Markdown document has: \n* styled a heading underlined with equal signs (`=`),\n* emphasized `week` in bold with double asterisks (`**`), \n* bulleted a list by prefacing each item with a number and a period, \n* and marked several lines as separate quotes with an angle bracket (`\u003e`) per quote. \n\n```\nMy Todo List\n============\n\nAt the end of this **week**, I plan to:\n\n1. Learn Markdown\n2. Write Markdown\n3. Share a Markdown note\n\nMy favorite quote is:\n\u003e If you didn't get it the first time\n\u003e Do not despair\n\u003e Try and try again\n\u003e ~ Anonymous\n```\n\nThe HTML equivalent to the above would be:\n```html\n\u003ch1\u003eMy Todo List\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of this \u003cstrong\u003eweek\u003c/strong\u003e, I plan to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLearn Markdown\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWrite Markdown\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eShare a Markdown note\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite quote is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    If you didn't get it the first time\u003cbr\u003e\n    Do not despair\u003cbr\u003e\n    Try and try again\u003cbr\u003e\n    ~ Anonymous\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n```\n\nWhen viewed on a Markdown parser such as [Stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#), you will see this:\n![Markdown Rendering on Stackedit.io](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/What-is-Markdown/stack_edit_md_parser.jpg)\n\nor this, based on Codecademy's parser:\n\nMy Todo List\n==========\n\nAt the end of this **week**, I plan to:\n\n1. Learn Markdown\n2. Write Markdown\n3. Share a Markdown note\n\nMy favorite quote is:\n\u003e If you didn't get it the first time\n\u003e Do not despair\n\u003e Try and try again\n\u003e ~ Anonymous\n\nWhile both parsers take the same Markdown input, they render slightly different HTML based on their internal configuration and CSS.\n\n## When to Use Markdown\n\nAfter knowing the many benefits of Markdown, you might want to consider using Markdown if you ever find yourself in any of these scenarios:\n\n* The only editor available to you supports just plain text.\n* Time is of the essence and you can't afford to learn how to use an unfamiliar rich-text editor.\n* You need to quickly outline your ideas in a structured but presentable manner.\n* You want your document to be portable so that it can convert to HTML, PDF, EPUB, and/or MOBI.\n\n## Markdown Document Extension\n\nContrary to popular belief, Markdown is not a document format. Therefore, it doesn't require a strict file extension naming convention, such as **.md**.  As the [official Markdown mailing list](https://superuser.com/questions/249436/file-extension-for-markdown-files) explains, Markdown isn't meant to take over the format of a file. Any file extension that you would normally use to name your text document such as **.txt** or **.text** is appropriate. However, organizations such as [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) have a preference to expect Markdown documents to appear with an **.md** or **.markdown** extension.\n\n## Markdown Applications\n\nSince Markdown has gained a lot of popularity, you will find Markdown content being accepted in many applications. \n\n* Website publishers that accept Markdown content include [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/support/can-i-use-markdown-on-wordpress-com), [Ghost](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/ghost/) and [BeakerBrowser](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/guides/create-a-markdown-site). Tools such as [Jekyll](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/), [Docusaurus](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/docusaurus/) and [MkDocs](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/mkdocs/) can convert Markdown documents into a static website geared for technical documentation.  Take a look at this [page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) rendered in HTML, and its text [source](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics.text) styled in Markdown.\n\n* Book publishers such as [LeanHub](http://help.leanpub.com/en/articles/2941344-leanpub-flavoured-markdown-vs-markua-for-writing-in-plain-text) accepts Markdown manuscripts and convert them to books for publication.\n\n* Slide-show presentations such as [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/) and [Cleaver](https://jdan.github.io/cleaver/#2) can convert Markdown slides into HTML for web viewing.\n\n## The Markdown Parser\n\nA Markdown parser is software written to parse the Markdown syntax in a text document and convert it to HTML syntax. The original Markdown parser was written in Perl, but you can find parser [implementations](https://github.com/markdown/markdown.github.com/wiki/Implementations) today in almost any programming language. Regardless, a basic Markdown parser should support the [core Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics):  paragraphs, headers, blockquotes, phrase emphasis, lists, code, images, and links.\n\nThere are Markdown parsers that are freely available on the Web: [StackEdit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#), [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io), [Parse](https://parsedown.org/demo) and [Markdown to HTML Converter](https://markdowntohtml.com/). In addition to parsing and rendering, both Parse and Markdown to HTML Converter also convert the Markdown document to raw HTML so that you can copy and paste the HTML to be used elsewhere.\n\n## Markdown Tutorial\n\nLet's learn a little more about the Markdown syntax. As mentioned above, you can simulate a `\u003ch1\u003e` HTML tag with a `#` Markdown symbol. Since there are six heading tags for HTML, from `\u003ch1\u003e` through `\u003ch6\u003e`, you can simulate this with `#` through `######` in Markdown. For example this Markdown syntax:\n\n```\n# This is a H1 heading\n## This is a H2 heading\n### This is a H3 heading\n#### This is a H4 heading\n##### This is a H5 heading\n###### This is a H6 heading\n```\n\nwill render this:\n\n# This is a H1 heading\n## This is a H2 heading\n### This is a H3 heading\n#### This is a H4 heading\n##### This is a H5 heading\n###### This is a H6 heading\n\n\nIn addition to numbered lists, you can style a bulleted list too.  There are three different symbols you can use to mark a line item as a bullet: asterisk (`*`), plus sign (`+`), or hyphen (`-`).\n\nFor example:\n```\n* Markdown\n+ HTML\n- XML\n```\n\nproduces this:\n\n* Markdown\n+ HTML\n- XML\n\nFor best practice, it is recommended to use the same marker throughout your list instead of mixing them like above.\n\nThe core Markdown syntax does not include nested lists (list within another list), but it allows adding paragraphs between list items. To do so, you need to add a blank line after a list item and indent 4 spaces or 1 tab before starting a paragraph. Some parsers are lenient and do not enforce 4 spaces but there should be some spacing.\n\n```\n* Markdown\n\n   Markdown is a lightweight markup language for styling text.\n\n* HTML\n\n   HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.\n```\n\nFor more examples of basic syntax, check out [CommonMark's reference guide](https://commonmark.org/help/).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"5fdb8d6a1b7dc10012ee9d2f\" /\u003e\n\n\n## The Markdown Flavors\n\nBecause the core Markdown language supports only a subset of HTML features, many independent developers have extended the Markdown syntax to incorporate more HTML compatibilities and customize it for their own organizations. Here are a few popular flavors of Markdown:\n\n+ [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) is a body of special-interest developers who work side-by-side on a proposal to standardize the Markdown syntax and offer extensive test suites to validate Markdown implementations against this specification. This standard has been used by other developers to base their code upon.\n\n+ GitHub Flavored Markup, or [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is GitHub's expanded dialect of Markdown based on CommonMark and is used throughout the GitHub platform by its active community.\n\n+ [Trello](https://help.trello.com/article/821-using-markdown-in-trello), a popular collaborative tool that organizes and tracks information through virtual boards and cards, implements a custom version of Markdown as well.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou've learned a lot about Markdown, specifically: \n\n+ What Markdown is and how it differs from HTML\n+ How you can benefit from Markdown \n+ Where and when to apply Markdown in various scenarios \n+ How to write Markdown to style your text and make it presentable \n+ What a Markdown parser is and where to locate one \n+ Where to find other flavors of Markdown that are used in industry \n\nAmazing job getting this far! Don't be shy in applying Markdown in your next document. In fact, this article and many others like this on Codecademy were prepared using Markdown! See?

As implied in its name, a [README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) file is a text file that is meant to be read as soon as someone views the repository. This file contains text to introduce, explain, and share the information required to understand what the project is about.\n\n![Comic with three panels in which a character clones a GitHub project, gets confused trying to use it, and finally realizes after three hours that there’s a README file explaining all of the steps](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/write-README/github-README.svg)\n\nSince a README file is often the first thing a visitor sees, it should tell the viewer how to install and use the project. There is no one good way to structure a README but there is only one bad way: not to include a README at all.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"618c2dd22e75b70021b69d57\" /\u003e\n\n## Conventions of a Good README File\nYour README file should be as good as your project itself. \n\nMake your project stand out and look professional by at least including the following elements in your README:\n- **Project Title**: the name of your project\n- **Description**: This is an extremely important component of the README. You should describe the main purpose of your project. Answer questions like “why did you build this project?” and “what problem(s) does it solve?”. It also helps to include your motivations for the project and what you learned from it.\n- **Features**: If your project has multiple features, list them here. Don’t be afraid to brag if your project has unique features that make it stand out. You can even add screenshots and gifs to show off the features.\n- **How to use**: Here, you should write step-by-step instructions on how to install and use your project. Any software or package requirements should also be listed here.\n- **Technologies**: List all the technologies and/or frameworks you used and what purpose they serve in your project.\n- **Collaborators**: If others have contributed to your project in any way, it is important to give them credit for their work. Write your team members’ or collaborators’ names here along with a link to their GitHub profile.\n- **License**: It’s also important to list a license on your README so other developers can understand what they can and cannot do with your project. You can use [this guide](https://choosealicense.com/) to help you choose a license.\n\nKeep READMEs brief but detailed. README should always be up-to-date and self-explanatory. If you have spent a lot of time on your project, you should also spend a good chunk of time on the README. It can help your future self as well when you step away for a while and need to get reacquainted with your project. Not to mention it'll leave a positive impression on future interviewers who look at your GitHub profile.\n\n## Using Markdown to Format READMEs\nKeep in mind that nobody wants to read a long block of unformatted text bloated with information. That is why a README file usually has the `.md` extension. Formatting README files with Markdown can give them flair and make them interesting to read.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"5f3b4f656caaba00183ea90f\" /\u003e\n\n### Use Headers\nEvery title or section (usage, license, etc.) in a README.md should be formatted as a header. Using headers and adding some HTML, we can achieve stuff like this: \n\n\u003cdiv style=\"background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green;\"\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e📕 Codecademy Docs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDocumentation for popular programming languages and frameworks.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBuilt by the community.

Something like this\n```\n## Usage\nPlease follow these steps to get your application up and running.\n\n### Requirements\nThe following packages are required for this script to work.\n- pandas\n- numpy\n- requests\n\nTo install these packages, you can simply run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n```\n\nGitHub will find the headers and include them in a table of contents based on the header hierarchy:\n\n![An image of a README on GitHub showing a table of contents for the project called \"My Awesome Project\". The headers include \"What does it do?\", \"Usage\" with a \"Requirements\" subsection, and \"License\".](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/write-README/table-of-contents.png)\n\n### Level Up READMEs With Media\nDocumentation doesn’t have to be boring. Go for images or videos to make a project more understandable and appealing! We can add the project’s logo, diagrams, screenshots, or even GIFs!\n\nFor Markdown files living in a repository, the path to the image can either be to an URL or to an image file in the repository. For example, if we had an image named `diagram.png` inside the `images` folder of the repository, we could reference it like so `![Use Case Diagram](./images/diagram.png)` in the **README.md**.\n\n## Conclusion\nWrite engaging READMEs! Make sure they include easy-to-follow details for your project. This improves your documentation skills and makes you a better developer and communicator of code.\n\nIf you want to see more examples of good READMEs, take a look at the README on Codecademy’s [40Phaser](https://github.com/Codecademy/40Phaser) and [stuff.js](https://github.com/Codecademy/stuff.js) repositories. For more information on GitHub’s formatting syntax, take a look at their [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"618c33656bed47001407e36d\" /\u003e\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"afc520cf3a2b03f07640e23ceae8f5ac","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T17:13:10+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T17:13:10+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T17:13:10+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Informational","id":"c5aebcf47a15a2dae91ce28d3b203a9c","description":null,"isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"github-markdown","title":"GitHub and Markdown","time":3,"type":"informational","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"Why learn Markdown?\n\nOnce we add our code to GitHub, how do we actually format the text in our repository?\n\nTechnically, we could use plaintext on everything.

We'll use a service called GitHub Pages to share our web page creations on the World Wide Web.\n\n\n## What is GitHub Pages?\n\n\nThere are many different ways to deploy a website to the public Internet. We'll be using GitHub's free service called GitHub Pages.\n\n\nWhy GitHub Pages? GitHub Pages offers a lot of features and flexibility, all for free. Some of the benefits include:\n\n\n* Easy setup\n* Seamless collaboration using Git and GitHub\n* Free hosting with \u003e95% uptime\n* Live updating with normal GitHub workflow\n\n\n## What is Deploying?\n\n\nDeploying is like publishing. When authors are ready for their work to be seen by the world, they publish it. When web developers are ready to share their projects, they deploy to the World Wide Web. Deployment is when a project is packaged and shared on the Internet. Unlike publishing, however, deployment may occur many, many times over the course of a software project.\n\n\n## Deployment on GitHub Pages\n\nDeploying to GitHub Pages is automatic. Once it's set up, deploying happens whenever you push your local changes to your remote, GitHub-hosted repository. Head to GitHub Pages' \u003ca href=\"https://pages.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esetup instructions\u003c/a\u003e and follow the steps exactly to get your main GitHub Pages page setup.\n\nWhen you first navigate to your newly deployed site it is possible that you will receive a 404 error. If this happens, and you are confident that you have followed all the steps as written, check back in 30 minutes to see if the deploy has successfully gone through.\n\n## Viewing Your Live Web Page\n\n\nThat's it! Your website is deployed to the Internet! You and anyone with whom you share this link can view your project by navigating in your browser to the URL `http://\u003cyour-github-username\u003e.github.io`.\n\n## Adding GitHub Pages Projects\n\nYou can set up your GitHub Pages to deploy every one of your repositories in addition to `\u003cusername\u003e.github.io`. This will allow you to ensure all of your sites are deployed automatically whenever you push to GitHub.\n\nIn GitHub, navigate to your `\u003cusername\u003e.github.io` repository and click __Settings__.\n![githubSettings](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20setup/githubsettings.png)\n\nWithin __Settings__, navigate to the __Source__ section within the __Github Pages__ section. From the dropdown menu, select __master branch__ and then click __Save__.\n![githubPagesSection](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20setup/githubpagessection.png)\n\nNow, all of your repositories can be found at `http://\u003cusername\u003e.github.io/\u003crepository-name\u003e`. Try creating a new repo with an HTML project inside it (perhaps push an old project to GitHub) and then navigate to the deployed page.\n\n## Deploying New Changes\n\nNow that your GitHub Pages site is set up, deploying new changes is easy. Every time you make a change to your site, use the normal GitHub flow. That is, use `git commit` and `git push` to send your changes to GitHub. After this, the GitHub site should update within a few seconds. Just refresh the page in your browser, and you're good to go!\n\nCongratulations on your first live web page!","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"6751c087006ec49fecbc2685310a8a79","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"62ae76d76f6f4321fb7eae061d54cb85","description":"In the following project, you will practice the commands associated with Git Rebase.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"github-rebase-off-platform-project","title":"Git Rebase Off-Platform Project","time":20,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"As a refresher, the Git rebase functionality helps branches keep up to date with the most recent changes in the main branch. We get a more linear history in the repository after rebasing. In this project, you will help two friends with their project of transcribing a story onto a GitHub repository.\n\nLet’s start with a bit of back story; Viraj and Noah collaborate to transcribe the children’s story of “The Little Black Fish” and store the text in a Github repository. They have broken the story into two parts, with Viraj working on part 1 while Noah types part 2. They track their progress in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/practice-rebase-off-platform-project)\n\nThey decided to work on separate branches to avoid conflicts in case there is any overlap. Viraj works in a branch named `part_1_Monday`, and Noah tracks his contributions in `part_2_Monday`. The main branch follows the most recent approved and merged work.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase-project/little-black-fish-two-branches.png\" alt=\"Screenshot: in the terminal, Git shows the most recent history of commits on the main branch.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nViraj and Noah started working on Monday and made some progress on their parts. They committed and pushed changes to their feature branches, `part_1_Monday` and `part_2_Monday`, respectively.\n\nNoah ends the day by creating a pull request and merging his changes to the `main` branch of the repository. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase-project/little-black-fish-two-branches-merge-changes.png\" alt=\"Similar to the commit history in the last screenshot, except the history now shows that changes from part_1_Monday were merged into main.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNote that both `main` and `part_2_Monday` track the same progress and `part_1_Monday` tracks its isolated progress while staying behind from the most recent changes. So let’s help Viraj keep his branch up to date with the most recent changes using the git rebase command. Please note that Viraj could alternatively pull origin main and merge the changes into his branch if he didn't care about maintaining all the interim commits. Nevertheless, we will proceed with rebasing to maintain the commits. \n\nLet's see if you can help them rebase the repository! [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/practice-rebase-off-platform-project) to your Github account and clone it onto your local computer. Make sure the input labeled \"Copy the `main` branch only\" is _unselected_ when you fork the repository \u0026mdash; otherwise, it won't copy the branches that Viraj and Noah are working in! Next, open a terminal and change your current directory to the directory of the local repository and visually observe the state of the branches: \n\n```\n\u003e git checkout part_1_Monday\n\u003e git pull\n\u003e git checkout part_2_Monday\n\u003e git pull\n```\n\nYou can use the following Git command to see a fuller picture of commits and progresses made in the branches: \n\n```\n\u003e git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all\n```\n\nNow, check out Viraj’s branch: \n\n```\n\u003e git checkout part_1_Monday\n```\n\nAnd rebase Viraj’s branch with `main`: \n\n```\n\u003e git rebase main\n```\nNotice that the `The Little Black Fish - Part 2` file in Viraj’s branch is updated with Noah’s changes. \n\nObserve the new state of the branches, visually: \n\n```\n\u003e git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all\n```\n## Walkthrough\n\nIf you need any more guidance to complete this project, we have a project walkthrough video for you:\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/85Lx8s_i4Yk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\nIn this tutorial, you applied `git rebase` in a repository.

It allows multiple people to work on the same project from anywhere. However, that doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of what GitHub has to offer. In this article, we will explore settings to customize our GitHub repository as well as discuss features that will take our repository to the next level.\n\nAll GitHub settings can be accessed by clicking the **Settings** tab on the main page of our repository. You can follow along with this article by opening your own repository settings!\n\n![A screenshot of a GitHub repository's settings tabs: General, Collaborators, Security \u0026 analysis, Branches, Webhooks, Notifications, Integrations, Deploy keys, Actions, Secrets, Pages](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/managing-a-github-repo/image-2-settings-menu.png)\n\n### The General Tab \n\nThe General tab allows us to change the basic repository information, such as its name and social media banner. It is where we can set a default branch. The default branch is the branch against which all pull requests and code commits are automatically made (typically this is already set to the `main` branch). \n\nIt’s also where we can enable or disable certain GitHub features like Wikis, Issues, Discussions, and more. We can also change merge options to only allow certain types of merges or automatically delete head branches. Most importantly, there’s the danger zone. \n\n#### The Danger Zone\n\n![A screenshot showing The Danger Zone in the Options tab of a GitHub repository's settings page.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/managing-a-github-repo/image-3-danger-zone.png)\n\nAs the name suggests, the danger zone is where one should take caution when changing settings. We can make a repository private or public, transfer ownership to another user, and archive or delete the repository.\n\n## Managing Collaborators \n\nBy default, only the owner of the repository or the organization can configure the settings of a repository and access the tools. We have to go through the repository settings’ Collaborators tab to grant other users or teams access. The specificity of permissions differs greatly between a user repository and an organization repository. \n\nAs always, we should use caution when granting permissions, especially to those outside of our immediate organization or team. They can make undesired changes to the code, host pages or packages on our behalf, or even leak private source code. \n\n### User Repository\n\nFor a user repository, the owner can easily add another user by clicking the “Add people” button and searching for their full name, email address, or username. The user will then have to accept the invitation. While the added user doesn’t have the same permissions as the owner of the repository, the user can still rename a branch and publish packages, among other things. For more information on the differences between the permission levels, check out [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository).\n\n![A screenshot showing the Manage Access tab of a GitHub repository's settings page. It shows a private user repository with four GitHub users added as collaborators.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/manage-repo/manage-access-collaborators.png)\n\n### Organization Repository\n\nGitHub Organizations provide its members a way to collaborate on multiple projects across multiple repositories. Owners or administrators of the organization can manage member access to the organization’s repositories. Adding a member to a repository is no different from the process in a user repository, with the exception of adding teams. In a GitHub Organization, admins can group members into teams and reference users by team names. You can read more about organization roles and their varying abilities on the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization).\n\n![A screenshot showing the Manage Access tab of a GitHub repository's settings page. It shows an organization repository with the organization members given different roles. The \"Admins\" team and a user are given the Write permission, and the \"Core\" team members, as well as one additional member, is given the Admin permission.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/manage-repo/organization-repo.png)\n\n#### Repository Roles\n\nBusinesses and institutions usually have a hierarchy that defines levels of authority and responsibilities. The same principles can be applied in a GitHub repository or organization; we don't want everyone to have admin privileges. Plus, it's strategic and secure to map levels of access. \n\nYou can check out [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) for a detailed breakdown of permissions for repository roles. You can also read about [creating custom repository roles](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization) to have a configurable set of permissions with a role name of your choice.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"619c4a7ce97f91001cea64e8\" /\u003e\n\n## Other Repository Features and Tools\n\nSo far, we've already discussed the GitHub features we will be using most of the time. However, GitHub has a ton of advanced tools and settings we should definitely take advantage of. While we will not be diving deep into these, we still want you to be aware of them so you can revisit them when the need arises. Each of the following features has a dedicated tab in the GitHub repository settings:\n\n- **Code Security \u0026 Analysis**: We can enable or disable a variety of security features for our repository. \n- [**Webhooks**](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks): We can use webhooks to get notifications when certain events happen. \n- **Email Notifications**: We can receive email notifications when push events are triggered. \n- **GitHub Apps**: Any open-source applications we use to extend our GitHub workflow or any third-party tools we integrate with GitHub will appear here. For example, Slack or CircleCI. \n- [**Deploy Keys**](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys): We can use the SSH keys generated here to grant servers access to a repository for deployment. \n- **Actions**: [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a powerful tool to automate, customize, and execute software workflows such as testing  The [Actions tab](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository) allows us to change the permissions. \n- **Secrets and variables**: Secrets are encrypted environment variables that can be used in Actions. \n- **Pages**: GitHub [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows us to host simple web pages straight from the repository. \n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"619c4c167ff745001cce9784\" /\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongrats on completing this article! It’s important to realize that GitHub is more than just a source code management tool. It has the ability to run tests on our code, host simple web pages, emulate our team hierarchy to designate permissions based on role, and much more! This is why we should spend time understanding and configuring all of the options available to us when creating a repository. Doing so will streamline our workflow and increase our productivity, making us happier developers at the end of the day.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"8d5a88da1bfe107f6d654ff010fa34fc","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"966238249099bf86b1912f1bf87bfb01","description":"This article explains what pull requests are, how to structure them to be concise, and why it’s important to do so.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"how-to-write-a-good-pull-request","title":"How To Write a Good Pull Request","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What Is a Pull Request?\nSonia, a new member of Codecademy’s engineering team, has just finished a snazzy navigation menu on a branch titled, “sonia_feature_navigation_menu”. Her changes will not be merged to the main branch until her pull request is approved. A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a feature of GitHub and other source code management tools to review code before merging it from one branch to another, usually the main branch.\n\nWhen Sonia creates a new pull request, her repository will automatically be set as the source repository and the project’s repository will be set as the destination repository. She will get the option to specify the source branch and the destination branch. She will be greeted with a preview of the changes between the two codebases and whether the branches can be merged automatically depending on code conflicts. In the Pull Request description field, Sonia must describe the code changes and what feature(s) this merge will add to the main branch.\n\n![An image showing that the sonia_feature_navigation_menu branch cannot be merged automatically into the main branch when comparing the two branches](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/branch-comparison.png)\n\nSonia’s proposed changes can then be accepted or rejected by her teammates. Each pull request has its own discussion forum, creating a place for collaborators to leave feedback. They will review Sonia’s code, suggest what should be removed or changed, and how her code can be simplified or improved. Any further commits Sonia makes to the source branch will automatically be reflected in the pull request. Once her changes are accepted by the project’s collaborators, her branch can be merged into the repository’s main branch. GitHub will keep this pull request in history as a record of the code change, Sonia’s contribution, and the discussion that took place.\n\nThis pull request process is not only a way to increase group knowledge or improve product quality but also an exceptional way to develop professional skills through group critique. Next, we will discuss how to write a good pull request.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61833ec19862e9000f9a8eb4\" /\u003e\n\n## How To Make a Good Pull Request\nCreating a pull request to present your work for feedback can be intimidating. We will dive into how to structure a pull request in a clear way that makes it easier for the author and the reviewers to discuss code changes.\n\n![A screenshot of \"Open a pull request page\" on GitHub.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/pull-request.png)\n\n### Follow a Pull Request Structure – What, Why, and How?\nConcisely explain the purpose of the pull request in the title. If the pull request adds a new feature, go for something like “Add frontend component for settings page”. If it’s to fix a typo, be specific and say “Fix name typos on the Contact Us page”.\n\nThe description is where all the juicy details are. You want the reviewers to know the thought process behind code changes and the options you have considered. It also helps to embed screenshots, GIFs, or even videos of your application so reviewers can anticipate what the code change in the pull request looks like.\n\nSome developers even have preconfigured templates or checklists on their repositories to ensure all pull requests contain just the relevant information. Following these guidelines help speed up collaborative critiques so the code can get merged faster!\n\n### Make Commit Messages Clear and Use Comments\nEven having self-explanatory commit messages and comments in the code makes reviewers’ jobs much easier. Consider the commit message, “OMG! It finally worked” versus the message, “Fix typos: add missing @ symbols in emails”. Moreover, adding comments in the code is always a good practice to help other developers understand the function of specific lines. It helps the reviewer in this case!\n\nOne feature of GitHub pull requests on the web interface is the ability to add discussion comments to any single line of code or chunk of code. This allows separation of concerns over multiple discussions.\n\n![A comment by a reviewer on a line of code: \"Let's make these variables lower-cased \u0026 snake-cased\"](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/comment.png)\n\n### Keep Pull Requests Small and Fast\nReduce the size of pull requests and respond to reviews quickly. Splitting big features into smaller parts is the best way to speed up review time. Not only does it result in less wasted work if the pull request gets rejected, but it will be easier to merge and review more thoroughly. Quickly respond to any feedback or requested changes. You want to ship code fast and make sure reviewers aren't stuck discussing an open pull request for ages!\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61834025d2454d001f3066e9\" /\u003e\n\n## Walkthrough of Two Codecademy Pull Requests\nPull requests allow a streamlined way for project team members to review the code of new features and bug fixes before it is merged to the main branch. To give you more exposure, we will be walking through the following two pull requests from the Codecademy GitHub organization.\n- A short pull request to [remove trailing spaces](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/pull/384) on the Codecademy [docs](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs) repository which is immediately approved.\n- A long pull request to [add a new component](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut/pull/1598) on the Codecademy [gamut](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut) repository which includes screenshots, comments, and a lively discussion before being approved.\n\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9EqP3GsE9N4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n  ","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"966238249099bf86b1912f1bf87bfb01","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"c8f5d85e5c164f42ee9d438bed97d7dd","description":"In this article, we will learn how and why we should use a **.gitignore** file to make cleaner and more secure code changes!","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"using-a-gitignore-file-in-your-github-repository","title":"Using a .gitignore File in Your GitHub Repository","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What is a .gitignore file?\n\nWhat happens when our Git repository contains certain files we never want to commit to a shared or public codebase? We want to be careful that `git add` doesn't accidentally move them to the staging area. That’s where a **.gitignore** file comes in. **.gitignore** is a plain text file that tells Git to intentionally ignore changes in certain files. This also ensures that no other contributor in the repository accidentally commits those files.\n\n## Why use a .gitignore file?\n\nEach line in **.gitignore** corresponds to a file, directory, or pattern we would like to ignore when staging. Using a **.gitignore** file results in cleaner staging areas and prevent files containing sensitive information from being committed. Some of the files or folders we should ignore include:\n- Configuration files with API or secret keys such as **.env**\n- Compiled binary files or production directories such as **build** or **dist**\n- Log files\n- Dependencies downloaded from a package manager such as **node_modules**\n- System files such as **thumbs.db** on Windows or **.DS_Store** on macOS\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12d11155fec0025fe8568\" /\u003e\n\n### .gitignore in action\n\nLet's say we run `git status` and see that operating system files, such as **thumbs.db** and **.DS_Store**, are staged and will be committed!\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the result of running the command \"git status\". The result shows all files are staged to be committed including the operating system files such as \"thumbs.db\" and \".DS_Store\".](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/add-file-before-gitignore.png)\n\nLet’s ignore those files using their exact names. For example, if we add these lines to our **.gitignore** file:\n```\n# Windows OS file\nthumbs.db\n\n# macOS OS file\n.DS_Store\n```\n\nGit will ignore the special operating system files for Windows and macOS. These files will never be committed for this particular repository regardless of their location in this project. Note that in the file, blank lines are ignored and lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.\n\nAfter unstaging and running `git add .` again, the output of `git status` shows that the **thumbs.db** and **.DS_Store** files have been ignored!\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the result after running the command \"git status\" again. The result shows all files that are staged to be committed but this time, the operating system files such as \"thumbs.db\" and \".DS_Store\" are not staged thanks to .gitignore.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/add-file-gitignore.png)\n\nLet's go over how to write a file yourself!\n\n## Creating a .gitignore File\nWe can create a **.gitignore** file easily using a terminal editor like `nano` or `emacs`, or just using a File explorer. Don't forget the `.` before the filename!\n\n**.gitignore** is usually placed in the root directory of the repository. The filenames inside a **.gitignore** file can be written relative to the location of the **.gitignore** file. For example, we could add the line\n```\nsrc/main.js\n```\nto ignore the file **main.js** under the **src/** directory.\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the creation of a .gitignore file using the command \"touch .gitignore\". Next, the commands \"ls\" and \"ls -a\" are used to show that since .gitignore is a hidden file, the \"-a\" flag is necessary](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/create-gitignore.png)\n\n**Note**: since **.gitignore** is a hidden file, we will need to add the `-a` flag to `ls` to see it.\n\n### Ignore a directory with .gitignore\nSometimes we want to ignore entire directories or specify certain files in a directory. Common directories to leave out of a Git repository are **node_modules** or **logs** folder. We can ignore an entire directory by simply adding its name to **.gitignore**:\n```\nnode_modules/\n```\nThis will ignore the **node_modules** directory, and all subdirectories and files inside them. The forward slash `/` specifies that we are ignoring the directory.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12e039ee01700124c0bc1\" /\u003e\n\n### .gitignore Patterns\nWe can take advantage of [patterns](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) to match multiple filenames. These help us handle special cases such as ignoring specific file types or ignoring all but one file inside a directory. Some examples of things that make up patterns are:\n* Wildcard `*` to match 0 or more characters except for `/`. For example, adding `*.html` to **.gitignore** would ignore all files ending with the `.html` extension. `example*` would match any file starting with `example` such as `example.txt` or `exampleHtmlFile.html`.\n* Negation `!` as a prefix to negate any file that would otherwise be ignored. For example, \n```\nindex*\n!public/index.css\n```\nwill ignore all files starting with `index` except for `src/index.css`. But, we cannot negate a file inside an ignored directory.\n* Square brackets `[]` can be used to match a single character from a set of characters or a range of characters. Note that the range can be alphabetical: `[a-z]` or `[A-Z]`, numeric `[0-9]`, or a set of characters. If we added `index.[a-i]*` with both the square bracket and wildcard to **.gitignore**, we would ignore `index.css` and `index.html` but not `index.js`, since \"j\" is outside of the `[a-i]` range.\n* Double asterisk `**` is used to match 0 or more directories. If we had a **temp** folder inside all of the folders in the root directory and we only wanted to match files with the `.log` extension, we could use the pattern `**/temp/*.log`.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12f6bb2791a001c367599\" /\u003e\n\n## GitHub Provided Templates\nWhen we create a new repository on GitHub, we have the option to add a **.gitignore** file from a list of templates. These templates are pulled from [GitHub’s gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore). For example, below is the template for Java projects.\n```\n# Compiled class file\n*.class\n\n# Log file\n*.log\n\n# BlueJ files\n*.ctxt\n\n# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)\n.mtj.tmp/\n\n# Package Files #\n*.jar\n*.war\n*.nar\n*.ear\n*.zip\n*.tar.gz\n*.rar\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nGood job on completing this article! .gitignore files are incredibly useful to make sure our repositories are only tracking changes on relevant files. They also ensure that we can keep files with sensitive data out of the staging area. You’ll come across **.gitignore** files in almost every project on GitHub.\n\nThis file is shared by the repository, so make sure your patterns are correct and take your time with creating your first **.gitignore** file! \n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"c8f5d85e5c164f42ee9d438bed97d7dd","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"f2c09be69043e44351a8d09c6607c02f","description":"Learn how to use Git Rebase in order to rewrite the history of your repository.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"git-rebase","title":"How To Use Git Rebase","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"When working with a Git repository, there will be a time when we need to combine changes from a working branch into another one. This can be accomplished with the use of the commands `merge` or  `rebase`. In this article, we’ll focus on `rebase` and see how it can work some magic in order to manage the future development of a product by simplifying git history. \n\n## What is Git Rebase?\n\nAt a high level, rebasing can be understood as “moving the base of a branch onto a different position”.  Think of it like a redo — “I meant to start here.” \n\nConsider that a team just completed a production release. While working on a completely new feature branch called `new_feature`, a co-worker finds a bug in the production release (`main` branch). In order to fix this, a team member creates a `quick_fix` branch, squashes the bug, and merges their code in to the `main` branch. At this point, the `main` branch and the `new_feature` branch have diverged and they each have a different commit history. We can visualize this in the image below:\n\n![A diagram showing that before rebase, branch commits stick out from the main line of development.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/before-rebase.svg)\n\nIf we want to bring the updated changes from `main` into `new_feature` one could use the `merge` command, but with `rebase` we can keep the Git commit history clean and easy to follow. By “rebasing” the `new_feature` branch onto the `main` one, we move all the changes made from `new_feature` to the front of `main` and incorporate the new commits by rewriting its history. We can see how this is done below:\n\n![A diagram showing that after rebase, commits over multiple branches get flattened into a single line.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/after-rebase.svg) \n\nWe can see above that the new “base” of our `new_feature` branch is the updated `main` branch with the previous changes from the bug fix implemented.\n\nOne of the major benefits of using Git rebase is that it eliminates unnecessary merge commits required by `git merge`. Most importantly, the history of the changes made in the main repository remains linear and follows a clear path of changes. This allows us to navigate the changes easier when viewing the changes in a `log` or `graph`. \n\n### Merge vs Rebase\n\nAlthough `git rebase` is an extremely useful tool to keep a Git repository clean and easy to follow, it doesn’t mean that one should _always_ stick to that command when integrating code changes. Let’s go over the definitions of `rebase` and `merge` one more time:\n\n- Git rebase: Reapplies commits on top of another base branch.\n\n- Git merge: joins two or more development histories together (creating a new merge commit).\n\nIn other words, Git merge preserves history as it happened, whereas rebase rewrites it. \n\nGenerally, if one is dealing with numerous branches, and the commit graph becomes really difficult to read, it can be very useful to use rebase instead of merge. Since Git rebase creates a linear history, it can be a lot easier to visualize the changes made and get a cleaner graph.\n\n![In the diagram, the history from only using Git merge shows lots of different paths representing different branches. Next to it, the path from using Git rebase is one straight line, with commits from a feature branch getting represented as a commit on the main branch.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/git-merge-vs-git-rebase.svg)\n\nIn the end, each team will develop their preferred method of integrating changes and preserving history. \nGenerally, it’s useful to use `merge` whenever we want to add changes of a branch **back** into the base branch. And `rebase` is useful whenever we want to add **changes of a base branch** back to a branched out branch. \n\n### Disadvantages of using rebase\n\nAs useful as Git rebase can be, it doesn’t come without risks. When using `git rebase` in our workflow it’s imperative to understand that rebase is a **destructive operation** and creates _new_ commits, which can make it complicated to track the context of any changes made. One common rule when using rebase is to only use it locally. That is to say, once something has been pushed then **do not** rebase it after that. Otherwise, things can get convoluted when rewriting history on a remote. \n\nSince we’re rewriting history we will also have to solve more commit conflicts. When we merge a branch, we only need to solve the conflicts once straight into the merge commit. However, when using rebase we might end up having to solve similar conflicts in previous commits that are being rewritten because rebase practically cherry-picks each commit individually and attempts to merge it in. If a commit introduces a conflict, rebase will complain about it even if the conflict is fixed in subsequent commits. In order to reduce the number of merge conflicts, it's suggested to rebase often and to also squash changes into one commit as much as possible.\n\nMoreover, make sure that the branch we're working on is not a shared branch. A shared branch meaning a branch that exists on the distant repository and that other people on our team could pull. Why should we avoid this? Well, remember that rebasing changes **commit history**. So if we share our commits publicly, and others start additional work based on those commits, our trees are no longer in sync after rebasing. As a golden rule, it’s important to only use rebase on a local branch that we're working on individually.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGit rebase can be a very powerful tool when working with numerous people and branches, if used correctly it allows everyone to view a very clean commit history and track what commits fixed given defects or whether or not a commit was included in a release. However, it’s critical to understand how it works and the risks that come with it since it’s a destructive operation. If done so correctly, it can result in a very fluid and effective workflow.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"f2c09be69043e44351a8d09c6607c02f","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"KanbanProject","id":"2d9a93c55ad34555924f3db7927ef884","description":"Contribute entries to Codecademy Docs!","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":false,"published":true,"slug":"contributing-to-the-codecademy-docs-repository","title":"Contributing to the Codecademy Docs Repository","time":0,"type":"kanban_project","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"progress":{"__typename":"KanbanProjectProgressSummary","content_item_id":"2d9a93c55ad34555924f3db7927ef884","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null,"type":"kanban_project","state":{"__typename":"Kanban","to_do":null,"done":null,"in_progress":null}},"kanbanProjectInformation":{"__typename":"KanbanProjectInformation","longOverview":"### Codecademy Entry\nIn this project, you will create and submit an entry to [Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs) on a chosen topic.\n\n### Example Entry\n\nHere is an example of a Codecademy Docs entry: [hashmaps in Java](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/hashmap)\n\n### Objectives\n\n- Clone the Codecademy Docs Repository onto your local machine.\n- Create an entry in Markdown on your local machine.\n- Create a pull request to add your entry to Codecademy Docs.\n- Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).\n- Revise your entry based on the feedback of the members of the Codecademy Content Team.\n\n### Prerequisites\n- GitHub\n- Reasonable understanding of [Markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/markdown)\n\n\n","resources":"- [How to Contribute to Codecademy Docs](https://dev.to/codecademy/how-to-contribute-to-codecademy-docs-1a77)\n- [Markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/markdown)\n- [GitHub official docs](https://docs.github.com/en)\n- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)","setupInstructions":"To contribute to Codecademy Docs, you will need a copy of the Codecademy Docs Repository on your local machine.

Displaying and sharing code is easy. Users can create profiles to save interesting codebases, follow other users, and host their code. We'll discuss how to round out a GitHub profile and how to be engaged in all that the community has to offer!\n\n## Github Profiles\n\nWith GitHub profiles, users can follow other users and see what they work on in their careers. A well-rounded GitHub profile will not only look good to recruiters but boost reputability when we want to make contributions to open source projects.\n\nA good GitHub profile will have several different projects, ideally with different concepts driving each project. Each project should have a well-written `README` document. This shows that the user can communicate their work with other developers through good code documentation.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/github-profile.svg\" alt=\"A diagram imitation of a GitHub profile, which includes the user photo, different projects stored in different repositories called Code Art, JavaScript Tools, and Personal Website. At the bottom, there is a contribution counter to show how often the user works on their code.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnother thing that suggests a well-rounded GitHub profile would be a filled-out activity tracker that displays how many contributions the user makes daily, whether to their own projects or community ones. \n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4a2d448b710016ffc299\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4cc9448b710016ffc2a2\" /\u003e\n\n## Exploring Code on GitHub\n\nA great way to find inspiration for your projects is to use GitHub's search feature. You can search for specific companies, developers, and even projects. For instance, you can easily search for projects relating to a Discord chatbot and then choose the target language, like C#. If you want to contribute to a Discord bot built-in C# or grab some code to get yourself started on a chatbot, you can! \n\nAnother great place to look for projects pertaining to certain topics is the [GitHub Topics page](https://github.com/topics). Here, projects are grouped by topics like Arduino projects and algorithms.\n\nEven if you don't know what to look for, [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) will use existing projects in your GitHub profile to automatically find other projects you might be interested in. And, to see what other developers are currently interested in, you can check out [what's trending](https://github.com/trending) in the GitHub community!\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/github-trending-page.png\" alt=\"The image shows GitHub's trending page, full of recent popular projects from around the world.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4b931c625a00136c0888\" /\u003e\n\n## Open Source Projects On GitHub\n\nOpen source projects have their code open to the public and usually take code submissions from the developer community. For instance, NASA, Facebook, and Google all use GitHub for open-source projects. That means developers outside of those organizations volunteer to help with bug fixes and experiment on new features.\n\nWhile a company or developer might not want all of their projects to be open source, many big companies maintain open-source projects to stay in touch with the wider developer community and generate user interest. Google has many repositories where the broader community collaborates:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/google-open-source.png\" alt=\"Google's almost 2000 open repositories. At the top of the Google organization's page, the description says Google hearts Open Source.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnother example is Facebook has a repository named [Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly) which is used internally and has over 10,000 commits from developers from all over the world. That means that anyone who has made a commit to Folly can technically say they've helped add on to a project being used by Facebook.\n\nMaking contributions to open-source projects is a great way to grow your skill and experience. To contribute, you can start at any repository's issues page, where bugs and potential new features are listed.  Then, you can fork the repository to work on a specific issue and eventually make a pull request.\n\nYou can take a look at [these current open discussions in the Folly repository](https://github.com/facebook/folly/issues).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b489a22ca920017cc1624\" /\u003e\n\nNow that you know more about the GitHub community, feel free to start building up your profile by creating your own projects! You can also start exploring GitHub for other projects that you can fork or star. As you gain more experience, start looking at issues in projects and start fixing them!\n\n\n\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"cc6b56e2110a38780797c9bc702b5b20","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"e684b918f7c2bc76f9c93971ac1112a4","description":"This article links to a project to complete in a public GitHub repository.

The application, however, has a defect. The code tries to use the Python `random` library without importing it. \n\nLogin to GitHub from your terminal using GitHub CLI and follow the instructions to complete the authentication.\n\n```\n\u003e gh auth login\n```\n\nUse the command line to create a GitHub Issue documenting the problem:\n\n```\n\u003e gh issue create --title \"Fix magic8.py error\" --body \"The code for magic8.py uses the Python random library without importing it.

You can use the command line to directly make a pull request:\n\n```\ngh pr create\n```\n\nFollow the prompts and add the proper title and description for the pull request. Mention the id of the issue in the description following `#[id]` format so that GitHub automatically links the pull request to the issue. The following is an example description: \n\n\u003e This pull request imports the random library in magic8.py. Once merged, this resolves #1.\n\nTo check if this actually worked, you can check that the new pull request appears under the Pull Requests tab. Also, observe the state of the issue and see that the issue is now linked to the pull request. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-cli/github-cli-linked-pull-request-to-issue.png\" alt=\"On the GitHub web UI, we now see that the issue we created we linked to the new pull request that we created from the terminal.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAssuming that your pull request is good to go, you can merge your pull request using the following GitHub CLI command:\n\n```\ngh pr merge\n```\n\nOnce the pull request is merged, check back the status of the issues and notice that the issue is now closed and no longer listed under the open issues: \n\n```\ngh issue status\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWell done! You've now successfully used terminal commands to interact with GitHub APIs.

This is a built-in GitHub tracking tool for all the bugs, errors, and potential small feature changes for the project living inside the repository. In one view, collaborators of the repository can see what needs to be worked on (open issues) as well as which tasks were resolved (closed issues). Take a look at the [Codecademy docs Issue board](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/issues):\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/issues-board-docs.png\" alt=\"The image shows a board of about 10-15 tasks that each have a title, a user associated, and multiple labels that indicate language or type of issue.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe issue board acts as a forum for all the collaborators of the repository. In some instances, issue boards are public and users of a project can submit and discuss bugs they've encountered.\n\n#### Labels\nTo help organize issues when more and more pop up in a project, we can use labels. `bug` and `feature` are common labels used to differentiate between errors and new features. In the Codecademy Docs repo Issue board earlier, we could see labels such as `Good first issue`, if a suggested entry to Docs is `new` or an `edit`, and what language the entry should be in, like `C#` or `Java`. Labels help us toggle between different types of issues at a glance and have short names.\n\n#### Creating an Issue\nTo create an Issue, we can click the `New Issue` button on top of the Issues board. This will take us to a new page where to set the title and content of the issue. \n\nIssues are a bit like pull requests in that we want to keep the title specific but to the point. For descriptions, repositories often have their own guidelines (just like pull requests do) for including details. For example, if the issue is related to a bug, we should include the error message in the description. Check out a complete issue from the Facebook Folly repository:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/completed-issue.png\" alt=\"An issue with a title Typedef redefinition #1658. The user included in the description the error message they encountered. The history shows where else this issue was mentioned and closed and reopened.\"\u003e\n\nOnce the issue is posted and now open, collaborators and other GitHub users can add to the discussion and reference this issue by the `#` in other issues and pull requests.\n\n## GitHub Project Management\n\nGitHub projects is a beta feature (as of late 2021) for project management. While other project management tools exist, like JIRA or even handwritten post-its, GitHub projects allow direct integration within the repository, letting developers stay within the same ecosystem. We can also create automated project boards that trigger the status of issues and pull requests. And… it's completely free!\n\nTo try out projects, we can select the `New Project` option after clicking the `+` button on the upper right side of the GitHub dashboard. In most cases, projects are linked to repositories, which already have existing issues and pull requests, but in other cases, projects can be standalone.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/new-project.png\" alt=\"The dropdown menu from the top right of the GitHub dashboard, which shows the New Project option.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nAfter filling out the name and description of the new project, a drop-down will appear asking what Project template we want to use. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/project-types.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"The different project types include None, Basic kanban, Automated kanban, Automated kanban with reviews, and Bug triage.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe options range from different types of Kanban boards that can host issues and pull requests to a Bug Triage, which gives details into which bugs are high priority, low priority, or need further investigation. Once the board is created, we will [add issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board) to it.\n\nAn example of a laid-out GitHub project board is [Github's own public roadmap project](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/1), shown next. This is an example of a Project with no repository, as a roadmap can be used for organizational purposes.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/github-project-board.png\" alt=\"The GitHub public roadmap that includes major issues (each with labels) for each quarter.\"\u003e\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we learned about two GitHub features that can come in handy for teams: issues and projects.  We can use GitHub issues to keep track of tasks that need to be worked on. Those issues can then be referenced in pull requests, comments, or projects. GitHub projects are an even newer feature for project management purposes and can be linked to repositories. We can choose from a variety of different board types to organize tasks.\n\nWe encourage you to try these out if you want to incorporate project management into your GitHub experience!\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"59213c16722bda2f3f29cdbf5042aa19","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"a6c6ded77782d171d072c93332650fdf","description":"In this article, you'll learn about how GitHub Actions streamline the development workflow.

Or have you ever worked in a team where everyone promised the final version would work fine but ended up [erroring]? This is called the \"works on my machine\" syndrome in software development. \n\nNow imagine we could configure your [GitHub] repository to automatically run tests to verify the functionality of the codebase after each code change. Well… we can, using **GitHub Actions**!\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\n[GitHub Actions] is a powerful, advanced GitHub feature that enables users to define custom and automated workflows triggered on various types of events such as [pushing code] or [creating a pull request]. The workflows execute inside a temporary container running in GitHub infrastructure.\n\n## Tutorial: add automated testing to a repository\n\nIn this tutorial project, you will use GitHub Actions to integrate automatic unit tests to a repository. You will fork a public repository that contains a sample bank application and add a configuration to trigger (already written) unit tests in the repository. Try your best to follow along!\n\n### Bank account application\n\nThe [Bank Account repository] contains Python Flask application code to manage the balance of an imaginary checking account. To understand this tutorial, you don't need extensive Python knowledge or experience with the Flask framework. If you're curious though, the `README.md` file includes more details about the code. \n\n### Run tests on code push\n\nNow that we know what GitHub Actions are and how they enhance development workflows, let's continue by adding an action to a repository. Start by forking and then cloning [Codecademy's Bank Account repository]. Once you clone your forked copy of the repository from your GitHub account onto your local computer, create a new branch: \n\n```shell\ngit checkout -b \"add-auto-tests\"\n```\n\nIn your new branch, create a new directory and name it `.github`. Note that the dot in the beginning of the directory name is important. This is a keyword known to GitHub. \n\nThen create another directory inside the `.github` directory and name it `workflows`. GitHub looks for the definitions of GitHub Actions inside this directory. \n\nCreate a new `.yaml` file inside the directory. Let's name it `unittests.yaml` and paste the following content inside the file. Note that the indentation and spacing are important. \n\n```bash\nname: Continuous Integration\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Set up Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.10.0\n          architecture: x64\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: pip install -r requirements.txt \n      - name: Run Tests\n        run: python -m pytest\n```\n\nThe file introduces a new GitHub Action named `Continuous Integration` that is triggered on `push`, meaning that everytime a developer pushes a code to a branch where this file exists. The action then runs the following steps in the order of their definition on an `ubuntu-latest` container:\n\n1. Check out to the current Git branch.\n2. Set up Python on the container.\n3. Install the Python dependencies of the Bank Account app defined in `requirements.txt`.\n4. Run the unit tests using Pytest.\n\nAdd and commit your changes, then push the branch out to your remote repository on your GitHub account: \n\n```shell\ngit add . \ngit commit -a -m \"added a GitHub action to run unit tests automatically on code push\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin \"add-auto-tests\"\n```\n\nNow open your repository in a browser and navigate under the Actions tab. You should see a new workflow started a few seconds ago:\n\n![\"A new workflow being run in the GitHub Actions tab.\"]\n\nClick on the workflow to show the details. The logs for every individual step are available: \n\n![\"Workflow details showing the log for every step taken in the GitHub action.\"]\n\nClick through the steps to read the logs. Once the workflow finishes, you will see a green checkmark. If any of the unit tests fail, the workflow fails and you will see an email notification. You can try that by intentionally breaking one of the tests and pushing your code to your branch. \n\n### Run tests on pull request creation \n\nNow let`s make this GitHub Action workflow also run the tests when creating a new pull request. \n\nOpen `unittests.yaml` file and update the array of triggers to add `pull_request`:\n\n```shell\non: [push, pull_request]\n```\n\nCommit and push your change to the branch. Notice that an instance of a container to run the tests will begin under the Actions tab just like before. But now, create a pull request from the `add-auto-tests` branch to your `main` branch (on your own repository). The GitHub action will then run as an automated check and ensure the unit tests pass. If the action fails, the pull request cannot be merged. \n\n![\"All GitHub actions have run and passed the pull request checks.\"]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGitHub Actions enable automated workflows for developers. In this tutorial, we were able to add automated testing to a repository, which ensures quality control over the code. We encourage you to explore more GitHub Actions that can be configured to run other types of automation: docker builds, project compilation, tagging, releasing, and more!","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"a6c6ded77782d171d072c93332650fdf","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}}]}},"relevantDocs":{}},"exercises":{"byId":{"e1440253f93d04338207217c1b74c6ea":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"e1440253f93d04338207217c1b74c6ea","sourceId":null,"title":"Overview","slug":"remotes","published":true,"setup_command":"","created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"c":{"cmds":["gcc-7 -o run *.c -pthread -lm","./run"],"post":["rm run"]},"cpp":{"cmds":["g++-7 -o run *.cpp","./run"],"post":["rm run"]},"dotnet":{"cmds":["dotnet run"],"post":["rm -rf obj/ bin/"]},"go":{"cmds":["go build -o run {{ .fileName }}","./run"],"post":["rm run"]},"java":{"cmds":["javac {{ .fileName }}","java {{ .fileName | replace \".java\" \"\" }}"],"post":["rm *pid*log"]},"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]},"lol":{"cmds":["lci {{ .fileName }}"]},"lua":{"cmds":["lua {{ .fileName }}"]},"py":{"cmds":["python3 {{ .fileName }}"],"post":[]},"py2":{"cmds":["python {{ .fileName }}"]},"php":{"cmds":["php {{ .fileName }}"]},"r":{"cmds":["R -q -f {{ .fileName }}"]},"rb":{"cmds":["ruby {{ .fileName }}"]},"rmd":{"cmds":["R -q -e 'rmarkdown::render(\"{{ .fileName }}\", clean=TRUE, output_format=\"html_notebook\")'"]},"swift":{"cmds":["swift {{ .fileName }}"]},"golang":{"cmds":["go build -o run {{ .fileName }}","./run"],"post":["rm run"]},"py3":{"cmds":["python3 {{ .fileName }}"],"post":[]},"python":{"cmds":["python {{ .fileName }}"]},"python2":{"cmds":["python {{ .fileName }}"]},"python3":{"cmds":["python3 {{ .fileName }}"],"post":[]},"cs":{"cmds":["dotnet run"],"post":["rm -rf obj/ bin/"]},"fs":{"cmds":["dotnet run"],"post":["rm -rf obj/ bin/"]},"vb":{"cmds":["dotnet run"],"post":["rm -rf obj/ bin/"]}},"container_type":"default","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2024-02-20T18:18:35Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"6022c4d560cfad000fb48f15","slug":"curriculum","type":"static"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.016667},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe5051d197249ab390994","type":"Narrative","content":"So far, we've learned how to work on Git as a single user.

It helps you manage and record your source code history. GitHub, on the other hand, is a hosting service for repositories. Simply put, Git is the tool and GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.\n\nIn this lesson we'll take a look at the basic workflow used with GitHub, which goes like this:\n\n1. Create a branch\n2. Commit changes\n3. Create a pull request\n4. Review pull request\n5.

With Git, each teammate can create their own branch off of the main project in order to work on bug-fixes, new features, experimental code, etc. \n\nA branch is essentially a divergence from the main project. ​​When you branch out, git is essentially making a new state of your current code, upon which you can work, without affecting the important main state of the code. One can create as many branches as they wish and even create branches off of other branches.\n\nBy using separate branches, the main project remains intact and unaffected before the changes are reviewed and  merged into the project. \n\nEach repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, is called `main`. The `main` branch is usually the working version of a project and contains the production code, so it's very important to only merge clean and correct code into it!\n\nWhen someone wants to create a new feature, fix a bug, or just experiment, they should always create their own branch with a descriptive name. \n\nEach team will adopt their own best practices when working together and figuring out naming conventions. For example, the branch name `carlos_feature_dashboard_notifications` includes the author, branch type, and short branch description. Other teams may pick branch names to correspond to ticket numbers from their project management tool.\n","instructions":null}]},"79be33a752d545876fbbafbb4d806781":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"79be33a752d545876fbbafbb4d806781","sourceId":null,"title":"Adding and Committing Changes ","slug":"adding-and-committing-changes","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2021-10-28T18:59:17Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"container_type":"static-web","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2022-01-05T22:11:24Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"61d6178f5a19e700169a8867","slug":"blank-workspace","type":"static-web"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.3},"components":[{"__typename":"LayoutImage","id":"61d49fc30276cb000f76a238","type":"Image","image_url":"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-flow/github-flow-commit-changes.svg","alt_text":"commit changes"},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"617af4dc4380400012042d9d","type":"Narrative","content":"Let's assume you were recently assigned to a team to develop a feature for an app. You clone (download) the entire app repository from GitHub, create a new branch from the `main` branch for your feature, and begin coding a new file in your local Git environment. \n\nAfter testing your code and ensuring that everything is running correctly, it's time to commit the changes and push them to the remote repository!\n\nAs a refresher, the `git commit` command records changes to one or more files in your branch, assigning the commit a unique ID that identifies who created the changes, what changes were made, and _when_ the changes were committed.\n\nAdd a commit message describing your work and finally, push the commit to the remote GitHub repository.","instructions":null}]},"c6b97bb86536d9169a7866a4b47e45c9":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"c6b97bb86536d9169a7866a4b47e45c9","sourceId":null,"title":"Creating a Pull Request","slug":"creating-a-pull-request","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2021-10-28T19:09:51Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"container_type":"static-web","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2022-01-04T19:33:13Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"61d5d47b29505800258d8431","slug":"blank-workspace","type":"static-web"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.566667},"components":[{"__typename":"LayoutImage","id":"61d4a0f9295058001c8d8360","type":"Image","image_url":"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-flow/github-flow-open-pull-request.svg","alt_text":"open pull request"},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"617af5b485c821000ea06129","type":"Narrative","content":"At this point, your work is ready to be reviewed before it's integrated into the official project.

GitHub Copilot is one such innovation—an advanced, AI-powered coding assistant designed to bring your coding experience to new heights. \n\n  \n\n## Key Features and Advantages \n\n  \n\nAs the name suggests, GitHub Copilot is your co-pilot in the world of coding. It's like having a seasoned developer by your side, ready to assist and guide you as you craft your digital creations. With Copilot, you'll have: \n\n \n\n - **Code Autocompletion**: As you type, Copilot seamlessly integrates intelligent code suggestions, helping you write code faster and with fewer errors. \n\n  \n\n- **Code Translation**: Copilot takes natural language comments and translates them into actionable code, bridging the gap between your ideas and implementation. \n\n  \n\n- **Code Documentation**: In-line code explanations and documentation assistance make understanding and maintaining your code a breeze. \n\n  \n\nThese features allow for many versatile use cases, from expediting code writing, to avoiding or resolving issues in your code. With this available across various programming languages and frameworks, it is also accessible to many developers.  \n\n  \n\nIn this article, we'll go deeper into how you can harness the power of GitHub Copilot. Whether you're new to this innovative tool or looking to optimize your existing setup, this guide will walk you through the process, step by step. So, let's get started and make coding a smoother, more efficient experience with GitHub Copilot by your side. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n# Setting Up GitHub Copilot for VS Code \n\n  \n\nNow that you have an understanding of what GitHub Copilot brings to the table, it's time to set it up in a code editor! While Copilot can be integrated into most popular editors and development environments, it integrates best with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), as both were developed by Microsoft. This section will guide you through the necessary steps to get GitHub Copilot up and running seamlessly. \n\n  \n\n## Purchasing GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nSadly, as the advanced comprehension required by GitHub Copilot needs the resources of many large servers, the service is not free. To purchase a subscription, simply visit the official [GitHub Copilot website](https://github.com/features/copilot), sign into your GitHub account, and get started. From here you only need to get it running in your development environment. \n\n  \n\n## Installing VS Code \n\n  \n\n### Windows \n\n  \n\n1. Visit the official [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). \n\n2. Download the Windows version of VS Code. \n\n3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. \n\n4. Once installation is complete, launch VS Code. \n\n  \n\n### macOS \n\n  \n\n1. Visit the official [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). \n\n2. Download the macOS version of VS Code. \n\n3. Open the downloaded disk image (.dmg) file. \n\n4. Drag and drop the VS Code app into your Applications folder. \n\n5. Launch VS Code from your Applications. \n\n  \n\n### Linux \n\n  \n\nOn Linux, the installation process can vary depending on your distribution. Here's a general guide: \n\n  \n\n1. Open your terminal. \n\n2. Depending on your Linux distribution, use the appropriate package manager to install VS Code. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use: \n\n  \n\n```bash \nsudo apt update \nsudo apt install code \n``` \n\n  \n\n3. Once installed, you can launch VS Code from your applications menu or by running `code` in your terminal. \n\n  \n\n## Accessing Extensions View \n\n  \n\nWith VS Code installed, now is the time to extend its capabilities in the Extensions view. This is where you can manage your VS Code extensions, including GitHub Copilot. \n\n  \n\n1. Open Visual Studio Code. \n\n2. Click on the square icon on the left sidebar (or use the keyboard shortcut \u003ckbd\u003eCtrl\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eShift\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eX\u003c/kbd\u003e on Windows/Linux or \u003ckbd\u003eCmd\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eShift\u003c/kbd\u003e+ \u003ckbd\u003eX\u003c/kbd\u003e on macOS) to open the Extensions view. \n\n \n\n  \n\n## Finding GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nIn the Extensions view, you'll find an extensive library of VS Code extensions. To locate and install GitHub Copilot, follow these steps: \n\n  \n\n1. In the Extensions view, type \"GitHub Copilot\" in the search bar at the top. \n\n2. GitHub Copilot should appear in the search results. Click on it to view more details. \n\n3. Click the \"Install\" button and VS Code will download and install GitHub Copilot seamlessly. \n\n  \n\n## Connecting Your GitHub Account \n\n  \n\nIn most cases, GitHub Copilot should prompt you to connect to your GitHub connect upon a successful installation. If this did not happen, follow these steps instead: \n\n  \n\n1. Open Visual Studio Code if it's not already running. \n\n2.

With the recent creation of GitHub Copilot, a cutting-edge AI-driven coding assistant, developers can now code better innovations more easily and quickly than ever before. To show-off just how easy Copilot can make programming, this project will walk through crafting a factorial calculator. [Factorials](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) serve as a great example of a simple problem that has many applications in statistics and algorithm design, such as counting the many arrangements of a group of objects. Even if it has been decades since your last statistics class, this functionality can still be easily built by leaving the specifics of these mathematical properties to Copilot. \n\n  \n\n### Setting Up GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nBefore diving into this new way of coding, it’s crucial to be properly set up. For an in-depth guide on setting up Visual Studio Code, we recommend reviewing our [GitHub Copilot setup article](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/intro-to-github-copilot/articles/setting-up-git-hub-copilot). For those more familiar with the process, here is a high-level overview of what is needed to follow along with this project: \n\n  \n\n1. **GitHub Account:** If you don’t have one, sign up [here](https://github.com/). \n\n2. **GitHub Copilot Subscription:** Copilot requires a subscription to use. This can be purchased with the option of a free trial [here](https://github.com/features/copilot). \n\n3. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** While Copilot can work in a variety of code editors, it integrates best with VSCode. Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). \n\n4. **GitHub Copilot Extension:** Once you're in VSCode, head over to the left extensions sidebar and search for \"GitHub Copilot\". Install this official extension and log in to your GitHub account when prompted. \n\n  \n\n### Working with GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nWith the setup complete, the easiest way to get started with Copilot is just to start typing away. While you code as usual, Copilot will make suggestions to speed up your development and proactively prevent errors. More precisely, this loop looks like this: \n\n  \n\n1. **Start Typing:** As you begin typing in VSCode, Copilot will automatically provide suggestions. \n\n2. **Accept Suggestions:** Press \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e to accept the auto-completion if Copilot correctly understood your intention. \n\n3. **Ask Copilot:** If you're unsure about how to implement the next feature, just write a comment describing the problem in a comment, such as `// How do I...`. Copilot will then attempt to give you the answer as another code suggestion in your text editor. \n\n4. **Continue Coding:** Keep the momentum going, coding the functions easiest to implement for you, and letting Copilot take the lead when feeling stuck. \n\n  \n\n### Having Copilot Write the Factorial Function \n\n  \n\nNow that we know the workflow of working with GitHub Copilot, let’s kick things off with the backbone of our calculator: the factorial function. \n\n  \n\nFactorials are easy to calculate. They are the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the given number. For example, the factorial of five, written as `5!`, is `5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`.  \n\n  \n\nTo get started, create a new Python file called `factorial_calculator.py`. Then, have GitHub Copilot help write the function to calculate the factorial: \n\n  \n\n1. Start by typing `def factorial(n):` in your Python file. \n\n2. GitHub Copilot should automatically suggest code similar to the following: \n\n```python \ndef factorial(n): \n    if n == 0: \n        return 1 \n    else: \n        return n * factorial(n-1) \n``` \n\n3. Press \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e to accept the suggestion. \n\n  \n\nVoila! In no time at all, you've got your function! \n\n  \n\nDo keep in mind that while the above example is the most common way to calculate a factorial, it is also possible for Copilot to recommend a different solution entirely. For example, instead of recursively multiplying each integer, a loop could be used to calculate the factorial iteratively. This may offer better performance in certain cases and highlights why general technical knowledge is still important even when leaving the coding to Copilot. \n\n  \n\n### Prompting Copilot to Build User Input for the Function \n\n  \n\nUser input is a great example of boilerplate code that is often written very similarly regardless of the application. With Copilot, not only is this precious time saved for the programmer, but edge cases that may be glossed over until they cause errors can be proactively prevented. To start making the calculator interactive: \n\n  \n\n1. Begin by typing `def get_factorial_input():`. \n\n2. Wait for Copilot's suggestion, which should be along the lines of: \n\n```python \ndef get_factorial_input(): \n    \"\"\" \n    Prompts the user for a non-negative integer and returns it. \n    Keeps prompting until a valid non-negative integer is provided. \n    \"\"\" \n    while True: \n        try: \n            # Get input from the user \n            num = int(input(\"Enter a non-negative integer for factorial computation: \")) \n\n            # Check if the number is non-negative \n            if num \u003e= 0: \n                return num \n            else: \n                print(\"Please enter a non-negative integer.\") \n        except ValueError: \n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\") \n``` \n\n3. Accept the suggestion by pressing \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e. \n\n  \n\nNow, combine the two functions by asking the user for input and then calculating the factorial: \n\n```python \nnumber = get_factorial_input() \nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}\") \n``` \n\n  \n\nAnd just like that, not only has input been built for calculating factorials, but an edge case that may not have crossed the mind of most programmers has also been solved! This is the power of GitHub Copilot! Faster software development with fewer errors from having analyzed millions of lines of code.  \n\n  \n\n### Write Tests for the Code with Copilot \n\n  \n\nAs we just saw, there may be many surprise use cases for our code. To ensure that our code works as expected, we can ask Copilot to write some common test cases for us. \n\n  \n\n1. Start with `def test_factorial():`. \n\n2. Copilot might suggest: \n\n```python \ndef test_factorial(): \n    assert factorial(5) == 120 \n    assert factorial(0) == 1 \n    assert factorial(7) == 5040 \n    print(\"All tests passed!\") \n``` \n\n3. Accept the suggestion and run the tests with `test_factorial()`. \n\n  \n\nIt is important to verify that these test cases work as expected. While Copilot will likely get many things right, there is a chance that it may misinterpret the intended functionality of the program. This again highlights that while Copilot can very much improve the speed, and possibly the quality, of software developers, it cannot replace them. A human will always be required to verify that the code matches the real-world goals it was originally set out to achieve. \n\n  \n\n### Continuing Your Programming Journey with Copilot \n\n  \n\nGitHub Copilot isn't just a tool; it's a revolution in how people develop software. It seamlessly integrates AI into the programmer's workflow, making coding more accessible and efficient. By following this guide, not only did you craft a nifty factorial calculator, but you also took a leap into the future of coding. Use it well, and happy programming!

We will break down a couple that are powerful for daily tasks.\n\n### Git stash\n\nLet's say you're working on experimental code on a fresh branch and realize that you forgot to add something to a previous commit in order to continue your work. In order to go to a different branch, one must always be at a clean commit point. In this case you don't want to commit your experimental code since it's not ready but you also don't want to lose all the code you've been working on.\n\nA good way to handle this is by using `git stash`, which allows you to get back to a clean commit point with a synchronized working tree, and avoid losing your local changes in the process. You're \"stashing\" your local work temporarily in order to update a previous commit and later on retrieve your work.\n\nThe flow when using `git stash` might look something like this:\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-stash-pop-diagram.svg\" alt=\"In this diagram, a coworker asks the programmer if they can work on something else while they have their current code open. Git stash allows their current code to be stashed as they finish the other update. Git stash pop puts the code changes back into the working directory.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile working on a file, you find a small bug in a separate file from a previous commit that needs to be fixed before you continue. \n\n```\n$ git stash\n```\n\nRunning the command above will store your work temporarily for later use in a hidden directory.\n\nAt this point, you can switch branches and do work elsewhere.\n\nOnce the bug is fixed, you want to retrieve the code you were working on previously, you can \"pop\" the work that was stored when you used `git stash`. \n\n```\n$ git stash pop\n```\n\nFrom here, you can continue your work and commit it when ready.\n\nComing up we have a short video demo’ing this in action.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gL3Safgahk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Git log\n\nAt this point you might be familiar with the command `git log`, which allows you to view the commit history of the branch you currently have checked out:\n\n![Git Log output shows recent commit history](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log.png)\n\nThere are other ways you can use `git log` in order to view recorded changes. Here are a few examples:\n\n- `git log --oneline` shows the list of commits in one line format.\n\n![Git Log online output shows recent commit history all in one line](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-oneline-2.png)\n\n- `git log -S \"keyword\"` displays a list of commits where the number of occurrences of the keyword changes within at least one file via addition, deletion, or modification. In the screenshot below, we use `git log -S \"Add\"` to find any commits where the number of occurrences of \"Add\" within a file changes.\n\n![The output of `git log -S \"Add\"` finds a commit where the number of occurrences of \"Add\" changes within a file.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-S.png)\n\n- `git log --oneline --graph` - `--graph` Displays a visual representation of how the branches and commits were created in order to help you make sense of your repository history. When used alone, the description can be very lengthy, so you can combine the command with `--oneline` in order to shorten the description.\n\n![Git log --online --graph outputs a graphical representation of commits, showing where branches were created earlier and merged.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-oneline-graph.png)\n\n## Git commit amend\n\nGit’s `--amend` flag is extremely useful when updating a commit, it allows you to correct mistakes and edit commits easily instead of creating a completely new one. \n\nLet's say you finish working on a lengthy feature and everything seems to be working fine so you commit your work. Shortly after, you realize you missed a few semicolons in one of your functions. You could technically create a new commit, but ideally, you want to keep all commits specific, clean, and succinct. To avoid creating a new one, you could create your changes, stage them with `git add` and then type the command `git commit --amend` to update your previous commit. \n\nIt's important to note that although it seems like `--amend` is simply updating the commit, what Git actually does is replace the whole previous commit. For this reason, when you execute the command `git commit --amend`, your terminal editor asks  you to update your commit message:\n\n![git-amend](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-commit-amend.png)\n\nHowever, if you want to keep the same commit message, you can simply add the flag `--no-edit`:\n\n```\n$ git commit --amend --no-edit\n```\n\n## Git alias commands\nWhen grouping commands together, you can end up writing very long lines of Git commands in the terminal such as:\n\n```\n$ git log --pretty=format:\"%h %s\" --graph\n```\n\nFortunately, Git offers a helpful feature that can make your Git experience simpler, easier, and more familiar: aliases.\n\nIf you have a set of commands that you use regularly and want to save some time from typing them, you can easily set up an alias for each command using Git config.\n\nBelow are a couple of examples:\n\n\n```\n$ git config --global alias.co \"checkout\"\n$ git config --global alias.br \"branch\"\n$ git config --global alias.glop \"log --pretty=format:\"%h %s\" --graph\"\n```\n\nOnce the aliases are configured, next time you want to check out to another branch you could type the command:\n\n```\n$ git co example_branch\n```\n\nInstead of:\n\n```\n$ git checkout example_branch\n```\n\nUsing Git aliases can create a much more fluid and efficient workflow experience when using Git. By getting creative with your aliases, you're able to wrap a sequence of Git commands into one in order to save time and effort.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"0ddf89185869cb4e33b94bdd15cb84c3","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Lesson","id":"41dac95eab590031fdfd96b778b43fdd","description":"Learn about a few different commands to switch between different versions of a Git project and when to use them.

With Git, each teammate can create their own branch off of the main project in order to work on bug-fixes, new features, experimental code, etc. \n\nA branch is essentially a divergence from the main project. ​​When you branch out, git is essentially making a new state of your current code, upon which you can work, without affecting the important main state of the code. One can create as many branches as they wish and even create branches off of other branches.\n\nBy using separate branches, the main project remains intact and unaffected before the changes are reviewed and  merged into the project. \n\nEach repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, is called `main`. The `main` branch is usually the working version of a project and contains the production code, so it's very important to only merge clean and correct code into it!\n\nWhen someone wants to create a new feature, fix a bug, or just experiment, they should always create their own branch with a descriptive name. \n\nEach team will adopt their own best practices when working together and figuring out naming conventions. For example, the branch name `carlos_feature_dashboard_notifications` includes the author, branch type, and short branch description.

Specifically, we'll walk through creating your personal GitHub account, setting up Git on your computer, starting your first Git repository, and connecting that repository to a GitHub repository.\n\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you've completed the lessons on \u003ca href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLearn the Command Line\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLearn Git\u003c/a\u003e. Now, prepare to use those skills on your personal computer! If some steps in this tutorial are confusing, have no fear; it will all come together by the end.\n\n\n## What are Git and GitHub?\n\n\nThis tutorial refers to Git and GitHub repeatedly. *Git* is a widely-used version control system used to manage code. Git allows you to save drafts of your code so that you can look back at previous versions and potentially undo complicated errors. A project managed with Git is called a *Git repository*. \n\n\n*GitHub* is a popular hosting service for Git repositories. GitHub allows you to store your local Git repositories in the cloud. With GitHub, you can backup your personal files, share your code, and collaborate with others.\n\n\nIn short, GitHub is a tool for working with Git. There are other services to host Git repositories, but GitHub is a trusted, free service used by organizations across the world, big and small.\n\n\n## Create a GitHub Account\n\n\nTo use GitHub, you will need a GitHub account.\n\n\nIn your own browser:\n\n\n1. Open a new browser tab\n2. Navigate to \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://github.com/\u003c/a\u003e \n3. Create an account\n\n\nIf you already have a GitHub account, continue to the next exercise.\n\n\nAfter you sign up, you will receive a verification e-mail. Be sure to verify your e-mail address to GitHub by following the instructions in that e-mail.\n\n\n## Git Setup for Mac and Windows\n\n\nNext, we will set up Git on your personal computer. Follow the instructions for your operating system.\n\n\n### Mac users:\n\n\n1\\. Launch the **_Terminal_** application. You can find it in __/Applications/Utilities/__. You can also use the **_Spotlight_** search tool (the little magnifying glass in the top right of your screen) to search for **_Terminal_**. Once **_Spotlight_** locates it, click on the result that says **_Terminal_**.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n2\\. When **_Terminal_** opens, type in `git` and press enter.\n \n3\\. If you don't already have Git installed, a dialog will appear saying that \"The 'git' command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?\" Click \"Install\".\n\n![macInstall](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_prompt.png)\n\nThen click \"Agree to the Terms of Service\" when requested.\n\n![macAgree](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_terms.png)\n\n4\\. When the download finishes, the installer will go away on its own signifying that Git is now installed! Click \"Done\" to finish the installation process.\n\n![macDone](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_finished.png)\n\n\nNow skip down to the \"Final Setup\" section below to finish setting up.\n\n\n### Windows users:\n\n\nThis portion of the guide assumes you have already installed a program called Git Bash which allows us access to Git on Windows. If you have not installed Git Bash, please refer to the previous tutorial on Command Line Interface (CLI) Setup and follow the instructions for installing Git Bash on Windows. Once you complete that you can continue with this guide.\n\n1\\. Open the Start menu and search for the app, git bash. You should see ‘Git Bash Desktop app’ appear. Press Enter or click on the Git Bash icon to open the app.\n\n![gitBashOpen](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_start.png)\n\nA new window will open that looks like this:\n\n![gitBashShell](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_shell_edited.png)\n\nThis window is our CLI, where we will use our Git commands.\n\n2\\. If you want to make sure that Git is installed, run `git --version` in the CLI. You should see a response that gives you the version of Git installed. It will look like this:\n\n![gitVersion](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_test_edited.png)\n\nGit can now be used in the Git Bash app!\n\nContinue on to finish setting up.\n\n\n### Final Setup\n\n\n1. Navigate to GitHub's articles on setting up your \u003ca href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGit username\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eemail\u003c/a\u003e and follow the instructions for each using Git Bash. \n2. GitHub offers two authentication options, HTTPS and SSH, to keep your work secure. This is a security measure that prevents anyone who isn't authorized from making changes to your GitHub repository. In this article, we will use HTTPS. \n    * To authenticate yourself in the terminal, you will need to generate a _Personal Access Token_ on GitHub. Navigate to GitHub's article on [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) and follow the instructions for creating a classic token. Be sure to check the box that grants the token `repo` scope \u0026mdash; this will allow you to write to the repository from the terminal on your machine.\n    * Once you get the token, make sure to copy it or keep the page open \u0026mdash; you will not be able to view the token again once you navigate away from the page and you'll need it later in the instructions!\n\n\n## Try It Out!\n\n\nNow you have everything you need to practice your Git skills on your local computer. Take a moment to run the commands below to initialize a Git repository. We will use this Git repository again later in this tutorial so make sure you complete these steps exactly as described.\n\n\n1. `mkdir git_practice` to make a new directory to practice.\n2. `cd git_practice` to make the new directory your working directory.\n3. `git init` to turn the current, empty directory into a fresh Git repository.\n4. `echo \"Hello Git and GitHub\" \u003e\u003e README.txt` to create a new README file (more on this later) with some sample text.\n5. `git add README.txt` to add the new file to the Git staging area.\n6. `git commit -m \"First commit\"` to make your first commit with the new README file.\n\n\n## Your First Remote Repository on GitHub\n\n\nFinally, we'll create a repository on GitHub and then link it to a local repository on your computer. This allows you to backup your work constantly and safely, so you never need to worry about losing your work again!\n\n\nNow, let's connect our local Git repository to GitHub.\n\n\n### Instructions\n\n\n1\\. In your Command Line Interface, make sure your current working directory is your new Git repository. Navigate there if not.\n\n\n2\\. Check the status of which files and folders are new or have been edited. There should be no files modified.\n\n\n```\n$ git status\n```\n\n\n3\\. On GitHub, create a new repository by clicking the __New repository__ button on the home page. \n![newRepository](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_button.svg)\n\n4\\. On the new repository page, give your repository a name. It's not necessary, but it would be convenient to name it the same as the directory, **git_practice**. After naming the repository, click __Create repository__.\n![createRepository](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_creation.svg)\n\n\n5\\. After creating a repository, GitHub displays the repository page. At the top of the page, make sure \"HTTPS\" is selected.\n![githubHttps](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_https.svg)\n\n\n6\\.The repository is empty, so it's time to connect it to your existing work. Copy the Git commands on the GitHub page, under the title \"...or push an existing repository from the command line\", and paste them into your Command Line Interface. Running these commands will add a remote repository, and then push your local repository to the remote repository. \n\nWhen asked for a username and password, type in your GitHub username as the username and paste your personal access token as the password, pressing \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e (or \u003ckbd\u003ereturn\u003c/kbd\u003e) after each. Don't be alarmed if you can't see the characters you are typing, they are intentionally hidden as a security measure.\n![githubCommands](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_push.svg)\n\n\n7\\. Once your Command Line Interface reports that the push is complete, refresh the page on GitHub. You should now see the text you wrote earlier in the README file, \"Hello Git and GitHub.\"\n\n\nGitHub automatically displays the contents of a file named **README.txt** if it exists in the repository. The README file is the perfect place to write a description of your project.\n\n\nThere you have it! Your first GitHub repository, linked to your local Git repository. You've taken some huge leaps, so be proud! Now you can use your knowledge of Git to track progress on your local computer and push that progress to GitHub whenever you want. You can rest easy knowing that each step of your progress is safely stored in GitHub.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"74bb71f3f3d5998245e9bbef934502d9","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"a6c65e4516831c607a89421e8e12492e","description":"Learn how to sign up for a GitHub account and share your code","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"what-is-github","title":"What is GitHub?","time":10,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What is GitHub?\n\nOne of the best ways to share what you've been learning with other people is to put your code on GitHub. GitHub is both a website and a service that facilitates software development by allowing you to store your code in containers, called _repositories_, and by tracking changes made to your code. In addition, it offers a hosting service and tools to build, test, and deploy code. \n\nGitHub uses [Git, a version-control development tool]( https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git), to manage your projects by tracking changes to files and allowing multiple people to work on the same project. Although both GitHub and Git have similar names, GitHub is a service, while Git is a development tool that can be used by you outside of and without GitHub. \n\n## Why is GitHub important?\n\nThere are many reasons why knowing about GitHub is important for your personal growth as a developer. A large part of the appeal of Github is the access it grants developers to the massive community of developers around the world who openly share their code, projects, and software development tools with each other. Therefore, if you want to continue working on your Git skills, creating your programming portfolio, or finding work, GitHub can help.  \n\n## How to Sign Up for an Account\n\nNow that you're aware of GitHub's benefits, you probably want to sign up for an account and try it out yourself. First, navigate to the home page of the GitHub website, [https://github.com](https://github.com). \n\nYou can click on the **Sign Up** button in the upper right corner or fill out your email and click on **Sign up for GitHub**, as highlighted in this screenshot: \n\n![Home page of the GitHub website with the **Sign Up** buttons highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-1-signup.png)\n\nYou’ll be taken to a page asking you to fill out your email. If you did so on the home page, it will already be filled out for you. If it isn’t filled out, enter the email you wish to use. \n\n![GitHub prompting for email with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-2-email.png)\n\nPick an email that you're comfortable sharing with peers and potential hires. Because of the way Git works, it's important to note that your email can be exposed publicly when you make a pull request or merge in code to a repository, making it visible to anyone looking through your projects. When you sign up for a new GitHub account, your email address is hidden by default.  \n\nOnce you have an email entered, click on “continue.” GitHub will then ask you to create a password. Fill out a password for your new account. \n\n![GitHub prompting for password with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-3-password.png)\n\nWhen you click on “continue,” GitHub will then ask you for a username. Fill out the user name you would like to use (you may need to try a few times to find one that’s available). \n\n![GitHub prompting for user name with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/Image-4-username.png)\n\nLike with email addresses, when choosing a username, it's wise to choose one you wouldn't mind future employers or colleagues seeing. A combination of your first and last name, like `firstnamelastname`, or using initials, like `i_lastname`, are good because they make it easy to find you on GitHub or identify you when you make [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) or [reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). Remember, you're likely using this account to share or access code. \n\nAlso be aware that usernames are first come, first serve and may not be available if someone else already claimed the username. Additionally, usernames may only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens are not allowed at the beginning or end. \n\nAfter you click on “continue,” GitHub will prompt to ask if you want to receive product updates and announcements. Make your selection and click “continue,” again. GitHub will then prompt you to solve a puzzle to prove you’re a human being. Click on “Verify” to view the puzzle. \n\nOnce you submit the solution to the puzzle, a “Create Account” button will appear. Click on it and GitHub will prompt you for an 8-digit code. GitHub will send you the code to the email you entered earlier. Enter the code from the email and GitHub will create your account.  \n\n## Settings\n\nOnce your account is created, GitHub will ask a couple of questions to personalize your experience. Fill these out or click on the “skip personalization” link at the bottom of the page. \n\nYou should now see a personal dashboard with a section for your projects and some messages: \n\n![GitHub personal dashboard](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-5-dashboard.png)\n\nNow you have your own GitHub account! You can continue to customize your account by:\n\n+ [setting your email to private](https://github.blog/2017-04-11-private-emails-now-more-private/) \n\n+ [setting up two-factor authentication](https://github.blog/2013-09-03-two-factor-authentication/)\n\nThat's it; you now have your very own GitHub account. 🎉\n\n## Recap\n\nWith more people working remotely and with teams distributed across different countries and time zones, GitHub and Git can be valuable tools for collaborating on projects. You can also use GitHub to work on any file-based project, such as writing documentation. \n\nLet's review what you did in this article:\n\n+ Learned that GitHub is both a website and service for storing and sharing code\n+ Learned that GitHub uses Git to facilitate software development by tracking changes\n+ Created your own GitHub account\n+ Enabled security features like keeping your email private and turning on two-factor authentication\n\n## Going Further\n\nOnce you feel comfortable navigating GitHub, consider doing the following:\n\n+ [Add information about yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile) in your profile, including an avatar, bio, location, etc.\n+ [Set your status](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile#setting-a-status) in your profile to let people know what you're doing.\n+ If you feel comfortable enough with Git, you can take a look at [this article on GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), GitHub's hosting service that allows you to create a personal website, \"project site\", based on a repository to make your portfolio site.\n+ If you're interested in paid accounts, GitHub has a [pricing page](https://github.com/pricing) with various types of accounts and features you can look at.\n\nShow the world what you can do with your code!","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"a6c65e4516831c607a89421e8e12492e","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Quiz","id":"e228cb3d06c7bbe9909d54249e444d7a","description":"Practice what you've learned about GitHub Flow with the following quiz!","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":false,"published":true,"slug":"github-flow-quiz","title":"GitHub Flow","time":10,"type":"quiz","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"progress":{"__typename":"QuizProgressSummary","content_item_id":"e228cb3d06c7bbe9909d54249e444d7a","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T17:03:24+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T17:08:45+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T17:08:45+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":[{"__typename":"QuizResult","at":"1714064604160","correct":4,"total":10},{"__typename":"QuizResult","at":"1714064924999","correct":8,"total":10}],"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}},"total":10,"correct":8,"pct":80,"highest_pct":80,"passed":true,"passed_any":true,"taken":true,"type":"quiz","quiz_attempts":[{"__typename":"QuizAttempt","at":"1714064604160","correct":4,"passed":false,"percent":40,"total":10},{"__typename":"QuizAttempt","at":"1714064924999","correct":8,"passed":true,"percent":80,"total":10}]},"assessment_ids":["6197d3ef6cf8ac00228d381b","6197d45e3f4a5f0017ba756e","6197d4d03f4a5f0025ba74fa","6197d4617ff745000ece93fb","6197d462e97f910016ea6108","6197d462a84efb0016025e9f","6197d63396a1400025e36fa6","6197d636694a900012267506","6197d82fec2da200132a463a","6197d8d17ff7450021ce9402"],"assessments":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoice","id":"6197d3ef6cf8ac00228d381b","type":"multiple_choice","prompt":"What is the name of the starting branch when creating a new GitHub repository?","correct_answer":0,"answers":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`main`","reason":"Correct!

Invented by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004, Markdown provides a lightweight syntax to style any text document so that it can be converted to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) for viewing and publishing.\n\n## Differences between HTML and Markdown\n\nMarkdown translates to HTML, but Markdown is not a replacement for HTML. Markdown’s syntax can be converted to a small subset of HTML tags to do things like format text, add links, display images, and more. You can even incorporate HTML elements inside a Markdown document. To render Markdown in HTML, though, you would need a tool called a Markdown parser (more about this parser later on).\n\n## Benefits of Using Markdown\n\nWhy would you use Markdown? Compared to HTML, writing text in Markdown is much faster because the syntax is simpler. The [authors of Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) intended Markdown to be a language for writing styled text with syntax that is just as easy to read as it is to write. \n\nImagine that we are writing down some important text on a sheet of paper. If we wanted to emphasize the text we might underline it, twice even! Similarly, in Markdown, we could write:\n\n```\nTitle of My Document\n====================\n```\n\nNotice that we have plain text that has a row of equal signs (`=`) to produce a first-level header, also known as `\u003ch1\u003e`. On a webpage, the heading will display as such:\n\nTitle of My Document\n====================\n\nThe amount of `=`s don't matter so long as there's at least one and it goes under the text. \n\nFor text that's important, but not as important as a first-level heading, we might just underline it once. In code, we could use a row of hyphens (`-`), like so:\n\n```\nSub-Title of My Document\n------------------------\n```\n\nto produce a second-level header, also known as `\u003ch2\u003e`:\n\nSub-Title of My Document\n------------------------\n\nBoth examples are valid Markdown syntax. It is intuitive and normal for headings to be in either format. Alternatively, you can format headings using the `#` character. We'll show more examples of different headings, but for now, here's an example of valid syntax for a `\u003ch1\u003e` heading:\n\n```\n# Title of My Document\n```\n\nFurthermore, a Markdown document without any HTML tags can be published as is because its syntax is already made for easy viewing.  For example, the following Markdown document has: \n* styled a heading underlined with equal signs (`=`),\n* emphasized `week` in bold with double asterisks (`**`), \n* bulleted a list by prefacing each item with a number and a period, \n* and marked several lines as separate quotes with an angle bracket (`\u003e`) per quote. \n\n```\nMy Todo List\n============\n\nAt the end of this **week**, I plan to:\n\n1.

Share a Markdown note\n\nMy favorite quote is:\n\u003e If you didn't get it the first time\n\u003e Do not despair\n\u003e Try and try again\n\u003e ~ Anonymous\n\nWhile both parsers take the same Markdown input, they render slightly different HTML based on their internal configuration and CSS.\n\n## When to Use Markdown\n\nAfter knowing the many benefits of Markdown, you might want to consider using Markdown if you ever find yourself in any of these scenarios:\n\n* The only editor available to you supports just plain text.\n* Time is of the essence and you can't afford to learn how to use an unfamiliar rich-text editor.\n* You need to quickly outline your ideas in a structured but presentable manner.\n* You want your document to be portable so that it can convert to HTML, PDF, EPUB, and/or MOBI.\n\n## Markdown Document Extension\n\nContrary to popular belief, Markdown is not a document format. Therefore, it doesn't require a strict file extension naming convention, such as **.md**.  As the [official Markdown mailing list](https://superuser.com/questions/249436/file-extension-for-markdown-files) explains, Markdown isn't meant to take over the format of a file. Any file extension that you would normally use to name your text document such as **.txt** or **.text** is appropriate. However, organizations such as [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) have a preference to expect Markdown documents to appear with an **.md** or **.markdown** extension.\n\n## Markdown Applications\n\nSince Markdown has gained a lot of popularity, you will find Markdown content being accepted in many applications. \n\n* Website publishers that accept Markdown content include [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/support/can-i-use-markdown-on-wordpress-com), [Ghost](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/ghost/) and [BeakerBrowser](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/guides/create-a-markdown-site). Tools such as [Jekyll](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/), [Docusaurus](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/docusaurus/) and [MkDocs](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/mkdocs/) can convert Markdown documents into a static website geared for technical documentation.  Take a look at this [page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) rendered in HTML, and its text [source](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics.text) styled in Markdown.\n\n* Book publishers such as [LeanHub](http://help.leanpub.com/en/articles/2941344-leanpub-flavoured-markdown-vs-markua-for-writing-in-plain-text) accepts Markdown manuscripts and convert them to books for publication.\n\n* Slide-show presentations such as [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/) and [Cleaver](https://jdan.github.io/cleaver/#2) can convert Markdown slides into HTML for web viewing.\n\n## The Markdown Parser\n\nA Markdown parser is software written to parse the Markdown syntax in a text document and convert it to HTML syntax. The original Markdown parser was written in Perl, but you can find parser [implementations](https://github.com/markdown/markdown.github.com/wiki/Implementations) today in almost any programming language. Regardless, a basic Markdown parser should support the [core Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics):  paragraphs, headers, blockquotes, phrase emphasis, lists, code, images, and links.\n\nThere are Markdown parsers that are freely available on the Web: [StackEdit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#), [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io), [Parse](https://parsedown.org/demo) and [Markdown to HTML Converter](https://markdowntohtml.com/). In addition to parsing and rendering, both Parse and Markdown to HTML Converter also convert the Markdown document to raw HTML so that you can copy and paste the HTML to be used elsewhere.\n\n## Markdown Tutorial\n\nLet's learn a little more about the Markdown syntax. As mentioned above, you can simulate a `\u003ch1\u003e` HTML tag with a `#` Markdown symbol. Since there are six heading tags for HTML, from `\u003ch1\u003e` through `\u003ch6\u003e`, you can simulate this with `#` through `######` in Markdown. For example this Markdown syntax:\n\n```\n# This is a H1 heading\n## This is a H2 heading\n### This is a H3 heading\n#### This is a H4 heading\n##### This is a H5 heading\n###### This is a H6 heading\n```\n\nwill render this:\n\n# This is a H1 heading\n## This is a H2 heading\n### This is a H3 heading\n#### This is a H4 heading\n##### This is a H5 heading\n###### This is a H6 heading\n\n\nIn addition to numbered lists, you can style a bulleted list too.  There are three different symbols you can use to mark a line item as a bullet: asterisk (`*`), plus sign (`+`), or hyphen (`-`).\n\nFor example:\n```\n* Markdown\n+ HTML\n- XML\n```\n\nproduces this:\n\n* Markdown\n+ HTML\n- XML\n\nFor best practice, it is recommended to use the same marker throughout your list instead of mixing them like above.\n\nThe core Markdown syntax does not include nested lists (list within another list), but it allows adding paragraphs between list items. To do so, you need to add a blank line after a list item and indent 4 spaces or 1 tab before starting a paragraph. Some parsers are lenient and do not enforce 4 spaces but there should be some spacing.\n\n```\n* Markdown\n\n   Markdown is a lightweight markup language for styling text.\n\n* HTML\n\n   HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.\n```\n\nFor more examples of basic syntax, check out [CommonMark's reference guide](https://commonmark.org/help/).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"5fdb8d6a1b7dc10012ee9d2f\" /\u003e\n\n\n## The Markdown Flavors\n\nBecause the core Markdown language supports only a subset of HTML features, many independent developers have extended the Markdown syntax to incorporate more HTML compatibilities and customize it for their own organizations. Here are a few popular flavors of Markdown:\n\n+ [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) is a body of special-interest developers who work side-by-side on a proposal to standardize the Markdown syntax and offer extensive test suites to validate Markdown implementations against this specification. This standard has been used by other developers to base their code upon.\n\n+ GitHub Flavored Markup, or [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is GitHub's expanded dialect of Markdown based on CommonMark and is used throughout the GitHub platform by its active community.\n\n+ [Trello](https://help.trello.com/article/821-using-markdown-in-trello), a popular collaborative tool that organizes and tracks information through virtual boards and cards, implements a custom version of Markdown as well.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou've learned a lot about Markdown, specifically: \n\n+ What Markdown is and how it differs from HTML\n+ How you can benefit from Markdown \n+ Where and when to apply Markdown in various scenarios \n+ How to write Markdown to style your text and make it presentable \n+ What a Markdown parser is and where to locate one \n+ Where to find other flavors of Markdown that are used in industry \n\nAmazing job getting this far! Don't be shy in applying Markdown in your next document. In fact, this article and many others like this on Codecademy were prepared using Markdown! See? We practice what we preach.\n\n\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"6fba6601220e1b9657e11e44908b106d","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T17:12:43+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T17:12:43+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T17:12:43+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"702044f78479af3df3ceb1baecf449aa","description":"External article for learning Markdown.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"ext-art-mastering-markdown","title":"Mastering Markdown","time":10,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"→ **[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)**\n\nIn this article, you will learn how to use Markdown for styling text on the web, such as creating links and adding code blocks.

As implied in its name, a [README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) file is a text file that is meant to be read as soon as someone views the repository. This file contains text to introduce, explain, and share the information required to understand what the project is about.\n\n![Comic with three panels in which a character clones a GitHub project, gets confused trying to use it, and finally realizes after three hours that there’s a README file explaining all of the steps](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/write-README/github-README.svg)\n\nSince a README file is often the first thing a visitor sees, it should tell the viewer how to install and use the project. There is no one good way to structure a README but there is only one bad way: not to include a README at all.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"618c2dd22e75b70021b69d57\" /\u003e\n\n## Conventions of a Good README File\nYour README file should be as good as your project itself. \n\nMake your project stand out and look professional by at least including the following elements in your README:\n- **Project Title**: the name of your project\n- **Description**: This is an extremely important component of the README. You should describe the main purpose of your project. Answer questions like “why did you build this project?” and “what problem(s) does it solve?”. It also helps to include your motivations for the project and what you learned from it.\n- **Features**: If your project has multiple features, list them here. Don’t be afraid to brag if your project has unique features that make it stand out. You can even add screenshots and gifs to show off the features.\n- **How to use**: Here, you should write step-by-step instructions on how to install and use your project. Any software or package requirements should also be listed here.\n- **Technologies**: List all the technologies and/or frameworks you used and what purpose they serve in your project.\n- **Collaborators**: If others have contributed to your project in any way, it is important to give them credit for their work. Write your team members’ or collaborators’ names here along with a link to their GitHub profile.\n- **License**: It’s also important to list a license on your README so other developers can understand what they can and cannot do with your project. You can use [this guide](https://choosealicense.com/) to help you choose a license.\n\nKeep READMEs brief but detailed. README should always be up-to-date and self-explanatory. If you have spent a lot of time on your project, you should also spend a good chunk of time on the README. It can help your future self as well when you step away for a while and need to get reacquainted with your project. Not to mention it'll leave a positive impression on future interviewers who look at your GitHub profile.\n\n## Using Markdown to Format READMEs\nKeep in mind that nobody wants to read a long block of unformatted text bloated with information. That is why a README file usually has the `.md` extension. Formatting README files with Markdown can give them flair and make them interesting to read.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"5f3b4f656caaba00183ea90f\" /\u003e\n\n### Use Headers\nEvery title or section (usage, license, etc.) in a README.md should be formatted as a header. Using headers and adding some HTML, we can achieve stuff like this: \n\n\u003cdiv style=\"background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green;\"\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e📕 Codecademy Docs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDocumentation for popular programming languages and frameworks.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBuilt by the community.

Something like this\n```\n## Usage\nPlease follow these steps to get your application up and running.\n\n### Requirements\nThe following packages are required for this script to work.\n- pandas\n- numpy\n- requests\n\nTo install these packages, you can simply run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n```\n\nGitHub will find the headers and include them in a table of contents based on the header hierarchy:\n\n![An image of a README on GitHub showing a table of contents for the project called \"My Awesome Project\". The headers include \"What does it do?\", \"Usage\" with a \"Requirements\" subsection, and \"License\".](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/write-README/table-of-contents.png)\n\n### Level Up READMEs With Media\nDocumentation doesn’t have to be boring. Go for images or videos to make a project more understandable and appealing! We can add the project’s logo, diagrams, screenshots, or even GIFs!\n\nFor Markdown files living in a repository, the path to the image can either be to an URL or to an image file in the repository. For example, if we had an image named `diagram.png` inside the `images` folder of the repository, we could reference it like so `![Use Case Diagram](./images/diagram.png)` in the **README.md**.\n\n## Conclusion\nWrite engaging READMEs! Make sure they include easy-to-follow details for your project. This improves your documentation skills and makes you a better developer and communicator of code.\n\nIf you want to see more examples of good READMEs, take a look at the README on Codecademy’s [40Phaser](https://github.com/Codecademy/40Phaser) and [stuff.js](https://github.com/Codecademy/stuff.js) repositories. For more information on GitHub’s formatting syntax, take a look at their [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"618c33656bed47001407e36d\" /\u003e\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"afc520cf3a2b03f07640e23ceae8f5ac","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T17:13:10+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T17:13:10+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T17:13:10+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Informational","id":"c5aebcf47a15a2dae91ce28d3b203a9c","description":null,"isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"github-markdown","title":"GitHub and Markdown","time":3,"type":"informational","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"Why learn Markdown?\n\nOnce we add our code to GitHub, how do we actually format the text in our repository?\n\nTechnically, we could use plaintext on everything.

We'll use a service called GitHub Pages to share our web page creations on the World Wide Web.\n\n\n## What is GitHub Pages?\n\n\nThere are many different ways to deploy a website to the public Internet. We'll be using GitHub's free service called GitHub Pages.\n\n\nWhy GitHub Pages? GitHub Pages offers a lot of features and flexibility, all for free. Some of the benefits include:\n\n\n* Easy setup\n* Seamless collaboration using Git and GitHub\n* Free hosting with \u003e95% uptime\n* Live updating with normal GitHub workflow\n\n\n## What is Deploying?\n\n\nDeploying is like publishing. When authors are ready for their work to be seen by the world, they publish it. When web developers are ready to share their projects, they deploy to the World Wide Web. Deployment is when a project is packaged and shared on the Internet. Unlike publishing, however, deployment may occur many, many times over the course of a software project.\n\n\n## Deployment on GitHub Pages\n\nDeploying to GitHub Pages is automatic. Once it's set up, deploying happens whenever you push your local changes to your remote, GitHub-hosted repository. Head to GitHub Pages' \u003ca href=\"https://pages.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esetup instructions\u003c/a\u003e and follow the steps exactly to get your main GitHub Pages page setup.\n\nWhen you first navigate to your newly deployed site it is possible that you will receive a 404 error. If this happens, and you are confident that you have followed all the steps as written, check back in 30 minutes to see if the deploy has successfully gone through.\n\n## Viewing Your Live Web Page\n\n\nThat's it! Your website is deployed to the Internet! You and anyone with whom you share this link can view your project by navigating in your browser to the URL `http://\u003cyour-github-username\u003e.github.io`.\n\n## Adding GitHub Pages Projects\n\nYou can set up your GitHub Pages to deploy every one of your repositories in addition to `\u003cusername\u003e.github.io`. This will allow you to ensure all of your sites are deployed automatically whenever you push to GitHub.\n\nIn GitHub, navigate to your `\u003cusername\u003e.github.io` repository and click __Settings__.\n![githubSettings](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20setup/githubsettings.png)\n\nWithin __Settings__, navigate to the __Source__ section within the __Github Pages__ section. From the dropdown menu, select __master branch__ and then click __Save__.\n![githubPagesSection](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20setup/githubpagessection.png)\n\nNow, all of your repositories can be found at `http://\u003cusername\u003e.github.io/\u003crepository-name\u003e`. Try creating a new repo with an HTML project inside it (perhaps push an old project to GitHub) and then navigate to the deployed page.\n\n## Deploying New Changes\n\nNow that your GitHub Pages site is set up, deploying new changes is easy. Every time you make a change to your site, use the normal GitHub flow. That is, use `git commit` and `git push` to send your changes to GitHub. After this, the GitHub site should update within a few seconds. Just refresh the page in your browser, and you're good to go!\n\nCongratulations on your first live web page!","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"6751c087006ec49fecbc2685310a8a79","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"62ae76d76f6f4321fb7eae061d54cb85","description":"In the following project, you will practice the commands associated with Git Rebase.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"github-rebase-off-platform-project","title":"Git Rebase Off-Platform Project","time":20,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"As a refresher, the Git rebase functionality helps branches keep up to date with the most recent changes in the main branch. We get a more linear history in the repository after rebasing. In this project, you will help two friends with their project of transcribing a story onto a GitHub repository.\n\nLet’s start with a bit of back story; Viraj and Noah collaborate to transcribe the children’s story of “The Little Black Fish” and store the text in a Github repository. They have broken the story into two parts, with Viraj working on part 1 while Noah types part 2. They track their progress in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/practice-rebase-off-platform-project)\n\nThey decided to work on separate branches to avoid conflicts in case there is any overlap. Viraj works in a branch named `part_1_Monday`, and Noah tracks his contributions in `part_2_Monday`. The main branch follows the most recent approved and merged work.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase-project/little-black-fish-two-branches.png\" alt=\"Screenshot: in the terminal, Git shows the most recent history of commits on the main branch.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nViraj and Noah started working on Monday and made some progress on their parts. They committed and pushed changes to their feature branches, `part_1_Monday` and `part_2_Monday`, respectively.\n\nNoah ends the day by creating a pull request and merging his changes to the `main` branch of the repository. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase-project/little-black-fish-two-branches-merge-changes.png\" alt=\"Similar to the commit history in the last screenshot, except the history now shows that changes from part_1_Monday were merged into main.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNote that both `main` and `part_2_Monday` track the same progress and `part_1_Monday` tracks its isolated progress while staying behind from the most recent changes. So let’s help Viraj keep his branch up to date with the most recent changes using the git rebase command. Please note that Viraj could alternatively pull origin main and merge the changes into his branch if he didn't care about maintaining all the interim commits. Nevertheless, we will proceed with rebasing to maintain the commits. \n\nLet's see if you can help them rebase the repository! [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/practice-rebase-off-platform-project) to your Github account and clone it onto your local computer. Make sure the input labeled \"Copy the `main` branch only\" is _unselected_ when you fork the repository \u0026mdash; otherwise, it won't copy the branches that Viraj and Noah are working in! Next, open a terminal and change your current directory to the directory of the local repository and visually observe the state of the branches: \n\n```\n\u003e git checkout part_1_Monday\n\u003e git pull\n\u003e git checkout part_2_Monday\n\u003e git pull\n```\n\nYou can use the following Git command to see a fuller picture of commits and progresses made in the branches: \n\n```\n\u003e git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all\n```\n\nNow, check out Viraj’s branch: \n\n```\n\u003e git checkout part_1_Monday\n```\n\nAnd rebase Viraj’s branch with `main`: \n\n```\n\u003e git rebase main\n```\nNotice that the `The Little Black Fish - Part 2` file in Viraj’s branch is updated with Noah’s changes. \n\nObserve the new state of the branches, visually: \n\n```\n\u003e git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all\n```\n## Walkthrough\n\nIf you need any more guidance to complete this project, we have a project walkthrough video for you:\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/85Lx8s_i4Yk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\nIn this tutorial, you applied `git rebase` in a repository.

It allows multiple people to work on the same project from anywhere. However, that doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of what GitHub has to offer. In this article, we will explore settings to customize our GitHub repository as well as discuss features that will take our repository to the next level.\n\nAll GitHub settings can be accessed by clicking the **Settings** tab on the main page of our repository. You can follow along with this article by opening your own repository settings!\n\n![A screenshot of a GitHub repository's settings tabs: General, Collaborators, Security \u0026 analysis, Branches, Webhooks, Notifications, Integrations, Deploy keys, Actions, Secrets, Pages](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/managing-a-github-repo/image-2-settings-menu.png)\n\n### The General Tab \n\nThe General tab allows us to change the basic repository information, such as its name and social media banner. It is where we can set a default branch. The default branch is the branch against which all pull requests and code commits are automatically made (typically this is already set to the `main` branch). \n\nIt’s also where we can enable or disable certain GitHub features like Wikis, Issues, Discussions, and more. We can also change merge options to only allow certain types of merges or automatically delete head branches. Most importantly, there’s the danger zone. \n\n#### The Danger Zone\n\n![A screenshot showing The Danger Zone in the Options tab of a GitHub repository's settings page.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/managing-a-github-repo/image-3-danger-zone.png)\n\nAs the name suggests, the danger zone is where one should take caution when changing settings. We can make a repository private or public, transfer ownership to another user, and archive or delete the repository.\n\n## Managing Collaborators \n\nBy default, only the owner of the repository or the organization can configure the settings of a repository and access the tools. We have to go through the repository settings’ Collaborators tab to grant other users or teams access. The specificity of permissions differs greatly between a user repository and an organization repository. \n\nAs always, we should use caution when granting permissions, especially to those outside of our immediate organization or team. They can make undesired changes to the code, host pages or packages on our behalf, or even leak private source code. \n\n### User Repository\n\nFor a user repository, the owner can easily add another user by clicking the “Add people” button and searching for their full name, email address, or username. The user will then have to accept the invitation. While the added user doesn’t have the same permissions as the owner of the repository, the user can still rename a branch and publish packages, among other things. For more information on the differences between the permission levels, check out [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository).\n\n![A screenshot showing the Manage Access tab of a GitHub repository's settings page. It shows a private user repository with four GitHub users added as collaborators.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/manage-repo/manage-access-collaborators.png)\n\n### Organization Repository\n\nGitHub Organizations provide its members a way to collaborate on multiple projects across multiple repositories. Owners or administrators of the organization can manage member access to the organization’s repositories. Adding a member to a repository is no different from the process in a user repository, with the exception of adding teams. In a GitHub Organization, admins can group members into teams and reference users by team names. You can read more about organization roles and their varying abilities on the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization).\n\n![A screenshot showing the Manage Access tab of a GitHub repository's settings page. It shows an organization repository with the organization members given different roles. The \"Admins\" team and a user are given the Write permission, and the \"Core\" team members, as well as one additional member, is given the Admin permission.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/manage-repo/organization-repo.png)\n\n#### Repository Roles\n\nBusinesses and institutions usually have a hierarchy that defines levels of authority and responsibilities. The same principles can be applied in a GitHub repository or organization; we don't want everyone to have admin privileges. Plus, it's strategic and secure to map levels of access. \n\nYou can check out [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) for a detailed breakdown of permissions for repository roles. You can also read about [creating custom repository roles](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization) to have a configurable set of permissions with a role name of your choice.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"619c4a7ce97f91001cea64e8\" /\u003e\n\n## Other Repository Features and Tools\n\nSo far, we've already discussed the GitHub features we will be using most of the time. However, GitHub has a ton of advanced tools and settings we should definitely take advantage of. While we will not be diving deep into these, we still want you to be aware of them so you can revisit them when the need arises. Each of the following features has a dedicated tab in the GitHub repository settings:\n\n- **Code Security \u0026 Analysis**: We can enable or disable a variety of security features for our repository. \n- [**Webhooks**](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks): We can use webhooks to get notifications when certain events happen. \n- **Email Notifications**: We can receive email notifications when push events are triggered. \n- **GitHub Apps**: Any open-source applications we use to extend our GitHub workflow or any third-party tools we integrate with GitHub will appear here. For example, Slack or CircleCI. \n- [**Deploy Keys**](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys): We can use the SSH keys generated here to grant servers access to a repository for deployment. \n- **Actions**: [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a powerful tool to automate, customize, and execute software workflows such as testing  The [Actions tab](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository) allows us to change the permissions. \n- **Secrets and variables**: Secrets are encrypted environment variables that can be used in Actions. \n- **Pages**: GitHub [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows us to host simple web pages straight from the repository. \n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"619c4c167ff745001cce9784\" /\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongrats on completing this article! It’s important to realize that GitHub is more than just a source code management tool. It has the ability to run tests on our code, host simple web pages, emulate our team hierarchy to designate permissions based on role, and much more! This is why we should spend time understanding and configuring all of the options available to us when creating a repository. Doing so will streamline our workflow and increase our productivity, making us happier developers at the end of the day.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"8d5a88da1bfe107f6d654ff010fa34fc","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"966238249099bf86b1912f1bf87bfb01","description":"This article explains what pull requests are, how to structure them to be concise, and why it’s important to do so.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"how-to-write-a-good-pull-request","title":"How To Write a Good Pull Request","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What Is a Pull Request?\nSonia, a new member of Codecademy’s engineering team, has just finished a snazzy navigation menu on a branch titled, “sonia_feature_navigation_menu”. Her changes will not be merged to the main branch until her pull request is approved. A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a feature of GitHub and other source code management tools to review code before merging it from one branch to another, usually the main branch.\n\nWhen Sonia creates a new pull request, her repository will automatically be set as the source repository and the project’s repository will be set as the destination repository. She will get the option to specify the source branch and the destination branch. She will be greeted with a preview of the changes between the two codebases and whether the branches can be merged automatically depending on code conflicts. In the Pull Request description field, Sonia must describe the code changes and what feature(s) this merge will add to the main branch.\n\n![An image showing that the sonia_feature_navigation_menu branch cannot be merged automatically into the main branch when comparing the two branches](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/branch-comparison.png)\n\nSonia’s proposed changes can then be accepted or rejected by her teammates. Each pull request has its own discussion forum, creating a place for collaborators to leave feedback. They will review Sonia’s code, suggest what should be removed or changed, and how her code can be simplified or improved. Any further commits Sonia makes to the source branch will automatically be reflected in the pull request. Once her changes are accepted by the project’s collaborators, her branch can be merged into the repository’s main branch. GitHub will keep this pull request in history as a record of the code change, Sonia’s contribution, and the discussion that took place.\n\nThis pull request process is not only a way to increase group knowledge or improve product quality but also an exceptional way to develop professional skills through group critique. Next, we will discuss how to write a good pull request.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61833ec19862e9000f9a8eb4\" /\u003e\n\n## How To Make a Good Pull Request\nCreating a pull request to present your work for feedback can be intimidating. We will dive into how to structure a pull request in a clear way that makes it easier for the author and the reviewers to discuss code changes.\n\n![A screenshot of \"Open a pull request page\" on GitHub.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/pull-request.png)\n\n### Follow a Pull Request Structure – What, Why, and How?\nConcisely explain the purpose of the pull request in the title. If the pull request adds a new feature, go for something like “Add frontend component for settings page”. If it’s to fix a typo, be specific and say “Fix name typos on the Contact Us page”.\n\nThe description is where all the juicy details are. You want the reviewers to know the thought process behind code changes and the options you have considered. It also helps to embed screenshots, GIFs, or even videos of your application so reviewers can anticipate what the code change in the pull request looks like.\n\nSome developers even have preconfigured templates or checklists on their repositories to ensure all pull requests contain just the relevant information. Following these guidelines help speed up collaborative critiques so the code can get merged faster!\n\n### Make Commit Messages Clear and Use Comments\nEven having self-explanatory commit messages and comments in the code makes reviewers’ jobs much easier. Consider the commit message, “OMG! It finally worked” versus the message, “Fix typos: add missing @ symbols in emails”. Moreover, adding comments in the code is always a good practice to help other developers understand the function of specific lines. It helps the reviewer in this case!\n\nOne feature of GitHub pull requests on the web interface is the ability to add discussion comments to any single line of code or chunk of code. This allows separation of concerns over multiple discussions.\n\n![A comment by a reviewer on a line of code: \"Let's make these variables lower-cased \u0026 snake-cased\"](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/comment.png)\n\n### Keep Pull Requests Small and Fast\nReduce the size of pull requests and respond to reviews quickly. Splitting big features into smaller parts is the best way to speed up review time. Not only does it result in less wasted work if the pull request gets rejected, but it will be easier to merge and review more thoroughly. Quickly respond to any feedback or requested changes. You want to ship code fast and make sure reviewers aren't stuck discussing an open pull request for ages!\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61834025d2454d001f3066e9\" /\u003e\n\n## Walkthrough of Two Codecademy Pull Requests\nPull requests allow a streamlined way for project team members to review the code of new features and bug fixes before it is merged to the main branch. To give you more exposure, we will be walking through the following two pull requests from the Codecademy GitHub organization.\n- A short pull request to [remove trailing spaces](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/pull/384) on the Codecademy [docs](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs) repository which is immediately approved.\n- A long pull request to [add a new component](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut/pull/1598) on the Codecademy [gamut](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut) repository which includes screenshots, comments, and a lively discussion before being approved.\n\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9EqP3GsE9N4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n  ","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"966238249099bf86b1912f1bf87bfb01","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"c8f5d85e5c164f42ee9d438bed97d7dd","description":"In this article, we will learn how and why we should use a **.gitignore** file to make cleaner and more secure code changes!","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"using-a-gitignore-file-in-your-github-repository","title":"Using a .gitignore File in Your GitHub Repository","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What is a .gitignore file?\n\nWhat happens when our Git repository contains certain files we never want to commit to a shared or public codebase? We want to be careful that `git add` doesn't accidentally move them to the staging area. That’s where a **.gitignore** file comes in. **.gitignore** is a plain text file that tells Git to intentionally ignore changes in certain files. This also ensures that no other contributor in the repository accidentally commits those files.\n\n## Why use a .gitignore file?\n\nEach line in **.gitignore** corresponds to a file, directory, or pattern we would like to ignore when staging. Using a **.gitignore** file results in cleaner staging areas and prevent files containing sensitive information from being committed. Some of the files or folders we should ignore include:\n- Configuration files with API or secret keys such as **.env**\n- Compiled binary files or production directories such as **build** or **dist**\n- Log files\n- Dependencies downloaded from a package manager such as **node_modules**\n- System files such as **thumbs.db** on Windows or **.DS_Store** on macOS\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12d11155fec0025fe8568\" /\u003e\n\n### .gitignore in action\n\nLet's say we run `git status` and see that operating system files, such as **thumbs.db** and **.DS_Store**, are staged and will be committed!\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the result of running the command \"git status\". The result shows all files are staged to be committed including the operating system files such as \"thumbs.db\" and \".DS_Store\".](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/add-file-before-gitignore.png)\n\nLet’s ignore those files using their exact names. For example, if we add these lines to our **.gitignore** file:\n```\n# Windows OS file\nthumbs.db\n\n# macOS OS file\n.DS_Store\n```\n\nGit will ignore the special operating system files for Windows and macOS. These files will never be committed for this particular repository regardless of their location in this project. Note that in the file, blank lines are ignored and lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.\n\nAfter unstaging and running `git add .` again, the output of `git status` shows that the **thumbs.db** and **.DS_Store** files have been ignored!\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the result after running the command \"git status\" again. The result shows all files that are staged to be committed but this time, the operating system files such as \"thumbs.db\" and \".DS_Store\" are not staged thanks to .gitignore.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/add-file-gitignore.png)\n\nLet's go over how to write a file yourself!\n\n## Creating a .gitignore File\nWe can create a **.gitignore** file easily using a terminal editor like `nano` or `emacs`, or just using a File explorer. Don't forget the `.` before the filename!\n\n**.gitignore** is usually placed in the root directory of the repository. The filenames inside a **.gitignore** file can be written relative to the location of the **.gitignore** file. For example, we could add the line\n```\nsrc/main.js\n```\nto ignore the file **main.js** under the **src/** directory.\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the creation of a .gitignore file using the command \"touch .gitignore\". Next, the commands \"ls\" and \"ls -a\" are used to show that since .gitignore is a hidden file, the \"-a\" flag is necessary](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/create-gitignore.png)\n\n**Note**: since **.gitignore** is a hidden file, we will need to add the `-a` flag to `ls` to see it.\n\n### Ignore a directory with .gitignore\nSometimes we want to ignore entire directories or specify certain files in a directory. Common directories to leave out of a Git repository are **node_modules** or **logs** folder. We can ignore an entire directory by simply adding its name to **.gitignore**:\n```\nnode_modules/\n```\nThis will ignore the **node_modules** directory, and all subdirectories and files inside them. The forward slash `/` specifies that we are ignoring the directory.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12e039ee01700124c0bc1\" /\u003e\n\n### .gitignore Patterns\nWe can take advantage of [patterns](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) to match multiple filenames. These help us handle special cases such as ignoring specific file types or ignoring all but one file inside a directory. Some examples of things that make up patterns are:\n* Wildcard `*` to match 0 or more characters except for `/`. For example, adding `*.html` to **.gitignore** would ignore all files ending with the `.html` extension. `example*` would match any file starting with `example` such as `example.txt` or `exampleHtmlFile.html`.\n* Negation `!` as a prefix to negate any file that would otherwise be ignored. For example, \n```\nindex*\n!public/index.css\n```\nwill ignore all files starting with `index` except for `src/index.css`. But, we cannot negate a file inside an ignored directory.\n* Square brackets `[]` can be used to match a single character from a set of characters or a range of characters. Note that the range can be alphabetical: `[a-z]` or `[A-Z]`, numeric `[0-9]`, or a set of characters. If we added `index.[a-i]*` with both the square bracket and wildcard to **.gitignore**, we would ignore `index.css` and `index.html` but not `index.js`, since \"j\" is outside of the `[a-i]` range.\n* Double asterisk `**` is used to match 0 or more directories. If we had a **temp** folder inside all of the folders in the root directory and we only wanted to match files with the `.log` extension, we could use the pattern `**/temp/*.log`.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12f6bb2791a001c367599\" /\u003e\n\n## GitHub Provided Templates\nWhen we create a new repository on GitHub, we have the option to add a **.gitignore** file from a list of templates. These templates are pulled from [GitHub’s gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore). For example, below is the template for Java projects.\n```\n# Compiled class file\n*.class\n\n# Log file\n*.log\n\n# BlueJ files\n*.ctxt\n\n# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)\n.mtj.tmp/\n\n# Package Files #\n*.jar\n*.war\n*.nar\n*.ear\n*.zip\n*.tar.gz\n*.rar\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nGood job on completing this article! .gitignore files are incredibly useful to make sure our repositories are only tracking changes on relevant files. They also ensure that we can keep files with sensitive data out of the staging area. You’ll come across **.gitignore** files in almost every project on GitHub.\n\nThis file is shared by the repository, so make sure your patterns are correct and take your time with creating your first **.gitignore** file! \n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"c8f5d85e5c164f42ee9d438bed97d7dd","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"f2c09be69043e44351a8d09c6607c02f","description":"Learn how to use Git Rebase in order to rewrite the history of your repository.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"git-rebase","title":"How To Use Git Rebase","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"When working with a Git repository, there will be a time when we need to combine changes from a working branch into another one. This can be accomplished with the use of the commands `merge` or  `rebase`. In this article, we’ll focus on `rebase` and see how it can work some magic in order to manage the future development of a product by simplifying git history. \n\n## What is Git Rebase?\n\nAt a high level, rebasing can be understood as “moving the base of a branch onto a different position”.  Think of it like a redo — “I meant to start here.” \n\nConsider that a team just completed a production release. While working on a completely new feature branch called `new_feature`, a co-worker finds a bug in the production release (`main` branch). In order to fix this, a team member creates a `quick_fix` branch, squashes the bug, and merges their code in to the `main` branch. At this point, the `main` branch and the `new_feature` branch have diverged and they each have a different commit history. We can visualize this in the image below:\n\n![A diagram showing that before rebase, branch commits stick out from the main line of development.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/before-rebase.svg)\n\nIf we want to bring the updated changes from `main` into `new_feature` one could use the `merge` command, but with `rebase` we can keep the Git commit history clean and easy to follow. By “rebasing” the `new_feature` branch onto the `main` one, we move all the changes made from `new_feature` to the front of `main` and incorporate the new commits by rewriting its history. We can see how this is done below:\n\n![A diagram showing that after rebase, commits over multiple branches get flattened into a single line.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/after-rebase.svg) \n\nWe can see above that the new “base” of our `new_feature` branch is the updated `main` branch with the previous changes from the bug fix implemented.\n\nOne of the major benefits of using Git rebase is that it eliminates unnecessary merge commits required by `git merge`. Most importantly, the history of the changes made in the main repository remains linear and follows a clear path of changes. This allows us to navigate the changes easier when viewing the changes in a `log` or `graph`. \n\n### Merge vs Rebase\n\nAlthough `git rebase` is an extremely useful tool to keep a Git repository clean and easy to follow, it doesn’t mean that one should _always_ stick to that command when integrating code changes. Let’s go over the definitions of `rebase` and `merge` one more time:\n\n- Git rebase: Reapplies commits on top of another base branch.\n\n- Git merge: joins two or more development histories together (creating a new merge commit).\n\nIn other words, Git merge preserves history as it happened, whereas rebase rewrites it. \n\nGenerally, if one is dealing with numerous branches, and the commit graph becomes really difficult to read, it can be very useful to use rebase instead of merge. Since Git rebase creates a linear history, it can be a lot easier to visualize the changes made and get a cleaner graph.\n\n![In the diagram, the history from only using Git merge shows lots of different paths representing different branches. Next to it, the path from using Git rebase is one straight line, with commits from a feature branch getting represented as a commit on the main branch.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/git-merge-vs-git-rebase.svg)\n\nIn the end, each team will develop their preferred method of integrating changes and preserving history. \nGenerally, it’s useful to use `merge` whenever we want to add changes of a branch **back** into the base branch. And `rebase` is useful whenever we want to add **changes of a base branch** back to a branched out branch. \n\n### Disadvantages of using rebase\n\nAs useful as Git rebase can be, it doesn’t come without risks. When using `git rebase` in our workflow it’s imperative to understand that rebase is a **destructive operation** and creates _new_ commits, which can make it complicated to track the context of any changes made. One common rule when using rebase is to only use it locally. That is to say, once something has been pushed then **do not** rebase it after that. Otherwise, things can get convoluted when rewriting history on a remote. \n\nSince we’re rewriting history we will also have to solve more commit conflicts. When we merge a branch, we only need to solve the conflicts once straight into the merge commit. However, when using rebase we might end up having to solve similar conflicts in previous commits that are being rewritten because rebase practically cherry-picks each commit individually and attempts to merge it in. If a commit introduces a conflict, rebase will complain about it even if the conflict is fixed in subsequent commits. In order to reduce the number of merge conflicts, it's suggested to rebase often and to also squash changes into one commit as much as possible.\n\nMoreover, make sure that the branch we're working on is not a shared branch. A shared branch meaning a branch that exists on the distant repository and that other people on our team could pull. Why should we avoid this? Well, remember that rebasing changes **commit history**. So if we share our commits publicly, and others start additional work based on those commits, our trees are no longer in sync after rebasing. As a golden rule, it’s important to only use rebase on a local branch that we're working on individually.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGit rebase can be a very powerful tool when working with numerous people and branches, if used correctly it allows everyone to view a very clean commit history and track what commits fixed given defects or whether or not a commit was included in a release. However, it’s critical to understand how it works and the risks that come with it since it’s a destructive operation. If done so correctly, it can result in a very fluid and effective workflow.\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"f2c09be69043e44351a8d09c6607c02f","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"KanbanProject","id":"2d9a93c55ad34555924f3db7927ef884","description":"Contribute entries to Codecademy Docs!","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":false,"published":true,"slug":"contributing-to-the-codecademy-docs-repository","title":"Contributing to the Codecademy Docs Repository","time":0,"type":"kanban_project","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"progress":{"__typename":"KanbanProjectProgressSummary","content_item_id":"2d9a93c55ad34555924f3db7927ef884","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null,"type":"kanban_project","state":{"__typename":"Kanban","to_do":null,"done":null,"in_progress":null}},"kanbanProjectInformation":{"__typename":"KanbanProjectInformation","longOverview":"### Codecademy Entry\nIn this project, you will create and submit an entry to [Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs) on a chosen topic.\n\n### Example Entry\n\nHere is an example of a Codecademy Docs entry: [hashmaps in Java](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/hashmap)\n\n### Objectives\n\n- Clone the Codecademy Docs Repository onto your local machine.\n- Create an entry in Markdown on your local machine.\n- Create a pull request to add your entry to Codecademy Docs.\n- Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).\n- Revise your entry based on the feedback of the members of the Codecademy Content Team.\n\n### Prerequisites\n- GitHub\n- Reasonable understanding of [Markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/markdown)\n\n\n","resources":"- [How to Contribute to Codecademy Docs](https://dev.to/codecademy/how-to-contribute-to-codecademy-docs-1a77)\n- [Markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/markdown)\n- [GitHub official docs](https://docs.github.com/en)\n- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)","setupInstructions":"To contribute to Codecademy Docs, you will need a copy of the Codecademy Docs Repository on your local machine.

Displaying and sharing code is easy. Users can create profiles to save interesting codebases, follow other users, and host their code. We'll discuss how to round out a GitHub profile and how to be engaged in all that the community has to offer!\n\n## Github Profiles\n\nWith GitHub profiles, users can follow other users and see what they work on in their careers. A well-rounded GitHub profile will not only look good to recruiters but boost reputability when we want to make contributions to open source projects.\n\nA good GitHub profile will have several different projects, ideally with different concepts driving each project. Each project should have a well-written `README` document. This shows that the user can communicate their work with other developers through good code documentation.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/github-profile.svg\" alt=\"A diagram imitation of a GitHub profile, which includes the user photo, different projects stored in different repositories called Code Art, JavaScript Tools, and Personal Website. At the bottom, there is a contribution counter to show how often the user works on their code.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnother thing that suggests a well-rounded GitHub profile would be a filled-out activity tracker that displays how many contributions the user makes daily, whether to their own projects or community ones. \n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4a2d448b710016ffc299\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4cc9448b710016ffc2a2\" /\u003e\n\n## Exploring Code on GitHub\n\nA great way to find inspiration for your projects is to use GitHub's search feature. You can search for specific companies, developers, and even projects. For instance, you can easily search for projects relating to a Discord chatbot and then choose the target language, like C#. If you want to contribute to a Discord bot built-in C# or grab some code to get yourself started on a chatbot, you can! \n\nAnother great place to look for projects pertaining to certain topics is the [GitHub Topics page](https://github.com/topics). Here, projects are grouped by topics like Arduino projects and algorithms.\n\nEven if you don't know what to look for, [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) will use existing projects in your GitHub profile to automatically find other projects you might be interested in. And, to see what other developers are currently interested in, you can check out [what's trending](https://github.com/trending) in the GitHub community!\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/github-trending-page.png\" alt=\"The image shows GitHub's trending page, full of recent popular projects from around the world.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4b931c625a00136c0888\" /\u003e\n\n## Open Source Projects On GitHub\n\nOpen source projects have their code open to the public and usually take code submissions from the developer community. For instance, NASA, Facebook, and Google all use GitHub for open-source projects. That means developers outside of those organizations volunteer to help with bug fixes and experiment on new features.\n\nWhile a company or developer might not want all of their projects to be open source, many big companies maintain open-source projects to stay in touch with the wider developer community and generate user interest. Google has many repositories where the broader community collaborates:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/google-open-source.png\" alt=\"Google's almost 2000 open repositories. At the top of the Google organization's page, the description says Google hearts Open Source.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnother example is Facebook has a repository named [Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly) which is used internally and has over 10,000 commits from developers from all over the world. That means that anyone who has made a commit to Folly can technically say they've helped add on to a project being used by Facebook.\n\nMaking contributions to open-source projects is a great way to grow your skill and experience. To contribute, you can start at any repository's issues page, where bugs and potential new features are listed.  Then, you can fork the repository to work on a specific issue and eventually make a pull request.\n\nYou can take a look at [these current open discussions in the Folly repository](https://github.com/facebook/folly/issues).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b489a22ca920017cc1624\" /\u003e\n\nNow that you know more about the GitHub community, feel free to start building up your profile by creating your own projects! You can also start exploring GitHub for other projects that you can fork or star. As you gain more experience, start looking at issues in projects and start fixing them!\n\n\n\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"cc6b56e2110a38780797c9bc702b5b20","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"e684b918f7c2bc76f9c93971ac1112a4","description":"This article links to a project to complete in a public GitHub repository.

The application, however, has a defect. The code tries to use the Python `random` library without importing it. \n\nLogin to GitHub from your terminal using GitHub CLI and follow the instructions to complete the authentication.\n\n```\n\u003e gh auth login\n```\n\nUse the command line to create a GitHub Issue documenting the problem:\n\n```\n\u003e gh issue create --title \"Fix magic8.py error\" --body \"The code for magic8.py uses the Python random library without importing it.

You can use the command line to directly make a pull request:\n\n```\ngh pr create\n```\n\nFollow the prompts and add the proper title and description for the pull request. Mention the id of the issue in the description following `#[id]` format so that GitHub automatically links the pull request to the issue. The following is an example description: \n\n\u003e This pull request imports the random library in magic8.py. Once merged, this resolves #1.\n\nTo check if this actually worked, you can check that the new pull request appears under the Pull Requests tab. Also, observe the state of the issue and see that the issue is now linked to the pull request. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-cli/github-cli-linked-pull-request-to-issue.png\" alt=\"On the GitHub web UI, we now see that the issue we created we linked to the new pull request that we created from the terminal.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAssuming that your pull request is good to go, you can merge your pull request using the following GitHub CLI command:\n\n```\ngh pr merge\n```\n\nOnce the pull request is merged, check back the status of the issues and notice that the issue is now closed and no longer listed under the open issues: \n\n```\ngh issue status\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWell done! You've now successfully used terminal commands to interact with GitHub APIs.

This is a built-in GitHub tracking tool for all the bugs, errors, and potential small feature changes for the project living inside the repository. In one view, collaborators of the repository can see what needs to be worked on (open issues) as well as which tasks were resolved (closed issues). Take a look at the [Codecademy docs Issue board](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/issues):\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/issues-board-docs.png\" alt=\"The image shows a board of about 10-15 tasks that each have a title, a user associated, and multiple labels that indicate language or type of issue.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe issue board acts as a forum for all the collaborators of the repository. In some instances, issue boards are public and users of a project can submit and discuss bugs they've encountered.\n\n#### Labels\nTo help organize issues when more and more pop up in a project, we can use labels. `bug` and `feature` are common labels used to differentiate between errors and new features. In the Codecademy Docs repo Issue board earlier, we could see labels such as `Good first issue`, if a suggested entry to Docs is `new` or an `edit`, and what language the entry should be in, like `C#` or `Java`. Labels help us toggle between different types of issues at a glance and have short names.\n\n#### Creating an Issue\nTo create an Issue, we can click the `New Issue` button on top of the Issues board. This will take us to a new page where to set the title and content of the issue. \n\nIssues are a bit like pull requests in that we want to keep the title specific but to the point. For descriptions, repositories often have their own guidelines (just like pull requests do) for including details. For example, if the issue is related to a bug, we should include the error message in the description. Check out a complete issue from the Facebook Folly repository:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/completed-issue.png\" alt=\"An issue with a title Typedef redefinition #1658. The user included in the description the error message they encountered. The history shows where else this issue was mentioned and closed and reopened.\"\u003e\n\nOnce the issue is posted and now open, collaborators and other GitHub users can add to the discussion and reference this issue by the `#` in other issues and pull requests.\n\n## GitHub Project Management\n\nGitHub projects is a beta feature (as of late 2021) for project management. While other project management tools exist, like JIRA or even handwritten post-its, GitHub projects allow direct integration within the repository, letting developers stay within the same ecosystem. We can also create automated project boards that trigger the status of issues and pull requests. And… it's completely free!\n\nTo try out projects, we can select the `New Project` option after clicking the `+` button on the upper right side of the GitHub dashboard. In most cases, projects are linked to repositories, which already have existing issues and pull requests, but in other cases, projects can be standalone.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/new-project.png\" alt=\"The dropdown menu from the top right of the GitHub dashboard, which shows the New Project option.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nAfter filling out the name and description of the new project, a drop-down will appear asking what Project template we want to use. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/project-types.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"The different project types include None, Basic kanban, Automated kanban, Automated kanban with reviews, and Bug triage.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe options range from different types of Kanban boards that can host issues and pull requests to a Bug Triage, which gives details into which bugs are high priority, low priority, or need further investigation. Once the board is created, we will [add issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board) to it.\n\nAn example of a laid-out GitHub project board is [Github's own public roadmap project](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/1), shown next. This is an example of a Project with no repository, as a roadmap can be used for organizational purposes.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/github-project-board.png\" alt=\"The GitHub public roadmap that includes major issues (each with labels) for each quarter.\"\u003e\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we learned about two GitHub features that can come in handy for teams: issues and projects.  We can use GitHub issues to keep track of tasks that need to be worked on. Those issues can then be referenced in pull requests, comments, or projects. GitHub projects are an even newer feature for project management purposes and can be linked to repositories. We can choose from a variety of different board types to organize tasks.\n\nWe encourage you to try these out if you want to incorporate project management into your GitHub experience!\n","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"59213c16722bda2f3f29cdbf5042aa19","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}},{"__typename":"Article","id":"a6c6ded77782d171d072c93332650fdf","description":"In this article, you'll learn about how GitHub Actions streamline the development workflow.

Or have you ever worked in a team where everyone promised the final version would work fine but ended up [erroring]? This is called the \"works on my machine\" syndrome in software development. \n\nNow imagine we could configure your [GitHub] repository to automatically run tests to verify the functionality of the codebase after each code change. Well… we can, using **GitHub Actions**!\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\n[GitHub Actions] is a powerful, advanced GitHub feature that enables users to define custom and automated workflows triggered on various types of events such as [pushing code] or [creating a pull request]. The workflows execute inside a temporary container running in GitHub infrastructure.\n\n## Tutorial: add automated testing to a repository\n\nIn this tutorial project, you will use GitHub Actions to integrate automatic unit tests to a repository. You will fork a public repository that contains a sample bank application and add a configuration to trigger (already written) unit tests in the repository. Try your best to follow along!\n\n### Bank account application\n\nThe [Bank Account repository] contains Python Flask application code to manage the balance of an imaginary checking account. To understand this tutorial, you don't need extensive Python knowledge or experience with the Flask framework. If you're curious though, the `README.md` file includes more details about the code. \n\n### Run tests on code push\n\nNow that we know what GitHub Actions are and how they enhance development workflows, let's continue by adding an action to a repository. Start by forking and then cloning [Codecademy's Bank Account repository]. Once you clone your forked copy of the repository from your GitHub account onto your local computer, create a new branch: \n\n```shell\ngit checkout -b \"add-auto-tests\"\n```\n\nIn your new branch, create a new directory and name it `.github`. Note that the dot in the beginning of the directory name is important. This is a keyword known to GitHub. \n\nThen create another directory inside the `.github` directory and name it `workflows`. GitHub looks for the definitions of GitHub Actions inside this directory. \n\nCreate a new `.yaml` file inside the directory. Let's name it `unittests.yaml` and paste the following content inside the file. Note that the indentation and spacing are important. \n\n```bash\nname: Continuous Integration\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Set up Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.10.0\n          architecture: x64\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: pip install -r requirements.txt \n      - name: Run Tests\n        run: python -m pytest\n```\n\nThe file introduces a new GitHub Action named `Continuous Integration` that is triggered on `push`, meaning that everytime a developer pushes a code to a branch where this file exists. The action then runs the following steps in the order of their definition on an `ubuntu-latest` container:\n\n1. Check out to the current Git branch.\n2. Set up Python on the container.\n3. Install the Python dependencies of the Bank Account app defined in `requirements.txt`.\n4. Run the unit tests using Pytest.\n\nAdd and commit your changes, then push the branch out to your remote repository on your GitHub account: \n\n```shell\ngit add . \ngit commit -a -m \"added a GitHub action to run unit tests automatically on code push\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin \"add-auto-tests\"\n```\n\nNow open your repository in a browser and navigate under the Actions tab. You should see a new workflow started a few seconds ago:\n\n![\"A new workflow being run in the GitHub Actions tab.\"]\n\nClick on the workflow to show the details. The logs for every individual step are available: \n\n![\"Workflow details showing the log for every step taken in the GitHub action.\"]\n\nClick through the steps to read the logs. Once the workflow finishes, you will see a green checkmark. If any of the unit tests fail, the workflow fails and you will see an email notification. You can try that by intentionally breaking one of the tests and pushing your code to your branch. \n\n### Run tests on pull request creation \n\nNow let`s make this GitHub Action workflow also run the tests when creating a new pull request. \n\nOpen `unittests.yaml` file and update the array of triggers to add `pull_request`:\n\n```shell\non: [push, pull_request]\n```\n\nCommit and push your change to the branch. Notice that an instance of a container to run the tests will begin under the Actions tab just like before. But now, create a pull request from the `add-auto-tests` branch to your `main` branch (on your own repository). The GitHub action will then run as an automated check and ensure the unit tests pass. If the action fails, the pull request cannot be merged. \n\n![\"All GitHub actions have run and passed the pull request checks.\"]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGitHub Actions enable automated workflows for developers. In this tutorial, we were able to add automated testing to a repository, which ensures quality control over the code. We encourage you to explore more GitHub Actions that can be configured to run other types of automation: docker builds, project compilation, tagging, releasing, and more!","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"a6c6ded77782d171d072c93332650fdf","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":null,"record":null}}]},"currentContentItem":{"__typename":"Project","id":"07ca666e69359fbbcfcdf32d6d3b76c6","description":"Create a web page which advertises a product called \"Excursion\" using HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.","isDeprecated":false,"isFree":false,"published":true,"slug":"f1-excursion","title":"Off-Platform Project: Excursion","time":42,"type":"project","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"progress":{"__typename":"ProjectProgressSummary","content_item_id":"07ca666e69359fbbcfcdf32d6d3b76c6","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-26T21:36:03+00:00","completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","last_updated":"2024-04-26T22:01:31+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":["0_0","0_1","0_2","0_3","0_4","0_5"],"kanban":null}},"progress_pct":46,"tasks_complete":6,"tasks_total":13,"status":1,"type":"project","checklist":{"0_0":"true","0_1":"true","0_2":"true","0_3":"true","0_4":"true","0_5":"true"}},"standalone":false,"projectInformation":{"__typename":"ProjectInformation","ein_config":{"extensions":{"c":{"cmds":["gcc-7 -o run *.c -pthread -lm","./run"],"post":["rm run"]},"cpp":{"cmds":["g++-7 -o run *.cpp","./run"],"post":["rm run"]},"dotnet":{"cmds":["dotnet run"],"post":["rm -rf obj/ bin/"]},"go":{"cmds":["go build -o run {{ .fileName }}","./run"],"post":["rm run"]},"java":{"cmds":["javac {{ .fileName }}","java {{ .fileName | replace \".java\" \"\" }}"],"post":["rm *pid*log"]},"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]},"lol":{"cmds":["lci {{ .fileName }}"]},"lua":{"cmds":["lua {{ .fileName }}"]},"py":{"cmds":["python3 {{ .fileName }}"],"post":[]},"py2":{"cmds":["python {{ .fileName }}"]},"php":{"cmds":["php {{ .fileName }}"]},"r":{"cmds":["R -q -f {{ .fileName }}"]},"rb":{"cmds":["ruby {{ .fileName }}"]},"rmd":{"cmds":["R -q -e 'rmarkdown::render(\"{{ .fileName }}\", clean=TRUE, output_format=\"html_notebook\")'"]},"swift":{"cmds":["swift {{ .fileName }}"]},"golang":{"cmds":["go build -o run {{ .fileName }}","./run"],"post":["rm run"]},"py3":{"cmds":["python3 {{ .fileName }}"],"post":[]},"python":{"cmds":["python {{ .fileName }}"]},"python2":{"cmds":["python {{ .fileName }}"]},"python3":{"cmds":["python3 {{ .fileName }}"],"post":[]},"cs":{"cmds":["dotnet run"],"post":["rm -rf obj/ bin/"]},"fs":{"cmds":["dotnet run"],"post":["rm -rf obj/ bin/"]},"vb":{"cmds":["dotnet run"],"post":["rm -rf obj/ bin/"]}},"container_type":"default","server":"http"},"download_path":null,"objective":"In this project, you'll create a web page which advertises a product called \"Excursion.\" You'll use your growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.

With the recent creation of GitHub Copilot, a cutting-edge AI-driven coding assistant, developers can now code better innovations more easily and quickly than ever before. To show-off just how easy Copilot can make programming, this project will walk through crafting a factorial calculator. [Factorials](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) serve as a great example of a simple problem that has many applications in statistics and algorithm design, such as counting the many arrangements of a group of objects. Even if it has been decades since your last statistics class, this functionality can still be easily built by leaving the specifics of these mathematical properties to Copilot. \n\n  \n\n### Setting Up GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nBefore diving into this new way of coding, it’s crucial to be properly set up. For an in-depth guide on setting up Visual Studio Code, we recommend reviewing our [GitHub Copilot setup article](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/intro-to-github-copilot/articles/setting-up-git-hub-copilot). For those more familiar with the process, here is a high-level overview of what is needed to follow along with this project: \n\n  \n\n1. **GitHub Account:** If you don’t have one, sign up [here](https://github.com/). \n\n2. **GitHub Copilot Subscription:** Copilot requires a subscription to use. This can be purchased with the option of a free trial [here](https://github.com/features/copilot). \n\n3. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** While Copilot can work in a variety of code editors, it integrates best with VSCode. Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). \n\n4. **GitHub Copilot Extension:** Once you're in VSCode, head over to the left extensions sidebar and search for \"GitHub Copilot\". Install this official extension and log in to your GitHub account when prompted. \n\n  \n\n### Working with GitHub Copilot \n\n  \n\nWith the setup complete, the easiest way to get started with Copilot is just to start typing away. While you code as usual, Copilot will make suggestions to speed up your development and proactively prevent errors. More precisely, this loop looks like this: \n\n  \n\n1. **Start Typing:** As you begin typing in VSCode, Copilot will automatically provide suggestions. \n\n2. **Accept Suggestions:** Press \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e to accept the auto-completion if Copilot correctly understood your intention. \n\n3. **Ask Copilot:** If you're unsure about how to implement the next feature, just write a comment describing the problem in a comment, such as `// How do I...`. Copilot will then attempt to give you the answer as another code suggestion in your text editor. \n\n4. **Continue Coding:** Keep the momentum going, coding the functions easiest to implement for you, and letting Copilot take the lead when feeling stuck. \n\n  \n\n### Having Copilot Write the Factorial Function \n\n  \n\nNow that we know the workflow of working with GitHub Copilot, let’s kick things off with the backbone of our calculator: the factorial function. \n\n  \n\nFactorials are easy to calculate. They are the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the given number. For example, the factorial of five, written as `5!`, is `5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`.  \n\n  \n\nTo get started, create a new Python file called `factorial_calculator.py`. Then, have GitHub Copilot help write the function to calculate the factorial: \n\n  \n\n1. Start by typing `def factorial(n):` in your Python file. \n\n2. GitHub Copilot should automatically suggest code similar to the following: \n\n```python \ndef factorial(n): \n    if n == 0: \n        return 1 \n    else: \n        return n * factorial(n-1) \n``` \n\n3. Press \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e to accept the suggestion. \n\n  \n\nVoila! In no time at all, you've got your function! \n\n  \n\nDo keep in mind that while the above example is the most common way to calculate a factorial, it is also possible for Copilot to recommend a different solution entirely. For example, instead of recursively multiplying each integer, a loop could be used to calculate the factorial iteratively. This may offer better performance in certain cases and highlights why general technical knowledge is still important even when leaving the coding to Copilot. \n\n  \n\n### Prompting Copilot to Build User Input for the Function \n\n  \n\nUser input is a great example of boilerplate code that is often written very similarly regardless of the application. With Copilot, not only is this precious time saved for the programmer, but edge cases that may be glossed over until they cause errors can be proactively prevented. To start making the calculator interactive: \n\n  \n\n1. Begin by typing `def get_factorial_input():`. \n\n2. Wait for Copilot's suggestion, which should be along the lines of: \n\n```python \ndef get_factorial_input(): \n    \"\"\" \n    Prompts the user for a non-negative integer and returns it. \n    Keeps prompting until a valid non-negative integer is provided. \n    \"\"\" \n    while True: \n        try: \n            # Get input from the user \n            num = int(input(\"Enter a non-negative integer for factorial computation: \")) \n\n            # Check if the number is non-negative \n            if num \u003e= 0: \n                return num \n            else: \n                print(\"Please enter a non-negative integer.\") \n        except ValueError: \n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.\") \n``` \n\n3. Accept the suggestion by pressing \u003ckbd\u003eTab\u003c/kbd\u003e. \n\n  \n\nNow, combine the two functions by asking the user for input and then calculating the factorial: \n\n```python \nnumber = get_factorial_input() \nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}\") \n``` \n\n  \n\nAnd just like that, not only has input been built for calculating factorials, but an edge case that may not have crossed the mind of most programmers has also been solved! This is the power of GitHub Copilot! Faster software development with fewer errors from having analyzed millions of lines of code.  \n\n  \n\n### Write Tests for the Code with Copilot \n\n  \n\nAs we just saw, there may be many surprise use cases for our code. To ensure that our code works as expected, we can ask Copilot to write some common test cases for us. \n\n  \n\n1. Start with `def test_factorial():`. \n\n2. Copilot might suggest: \n\n```python \ndef test_factorial(): \n    assert factorial(5) == 120 \n    assert factorial(0) == 1 \n    assert factorial(7) == 5040 \n    print(\"All tests passed!\") \n``` \n\n3. Accept the suggestion and run the tests with `test_factorial()`. \n\n  \n\nIt is important to verify that these test cases work as expected. While Copilot will likely get many things right, there is a chance that it may misinterpret the intended functionality of the program. This again highlights that while Copilot can very much improve the speed, and possibly the quality, of software developers, it cannot replace them. A human will always be required to verify that the code matches the real-world goals it was originally set out to achieve. \n\n  \n\n### Continuing Your Programming Journey with Copilot \n\n  \n\nGitHub Copilot isn't just a tool; it's a revolution in how people develop software. It seamlessly integrates AI into the programmer's workflow, making coding more accessible and efficient. By following this guide, not only did you craft a nifty factorial calculator, but you also took a leap into the future of coding. Use it well, and happy programming!

We will break down a couple that are powerful for daily tasks.\n\n### Git stash\n\nLet's say you're working on experimental code on a fresh branch and realize that you forgot to add something to a previous commit in order to continue your work. In order to go to a different branch, one must always be at a clean commit point. In this case you don't want to commit your experimental code since it's not ready but you also don't want to lose all the code you've been working on.\n\nA good way to handle this is by using `git stash`, which allows you to get back to a clean commit point with a synchronized working tree, and avoid losing your local changes in the process. You're \"stashing\" your local work temporarily in order to update a previous commit and later on retrieve your work.\n\nThe flow when using `git stash` might look something like this:\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-stash-pop-diagram.svg\" alt=\"In this diagram, a coworker asks the programmer if they can work on something else while they have their current code open. Git stash allows their current code to be stashed as they finish the other update. Git stash pop puts the code changes back into the working directory.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile working on a file, you find a small bug in a separate file from a previous commit that needs to be fixed before you continue. \n\n```\n$ git stash\n```\n\nRunning the command above will store your work temporarily for later use in a hidden directory.\n\nAt this point, you can switch branches and do work elsewhere.\n\nOnce the bug is fixed, you want to retrieve the code you were working on previously, you can \"pop\" the work that was stored when you used `git stash`. \n\n```\n$ git stash pop\n```\n\nFrom here, you can continue your work and commit it when ready.\n\nComing up we have a short video demo’ing this in action.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gL3Safgahk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Git log\n\nAt this point you might be familiar with the command `git log`, which allows you to view the commit history of the branch you currently have checked out:\n\n![Git Log output shows recent commit history](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log.png)\n\nThere are other ways you can use `git log` in order to view recorded changes. Here are a few examples:\n\n- `git log --oneline` shows the list of commits in one line format.\n\n![Git Log online output shows recent commit history all in one line](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-oneline-2.png)\n\n- `git log -S \"keyword\"` displays a list of commits where the number of occurrences of the keyword changes within at least one file via addition, deletion, or modification. In the screenshot below, we use `git log -S \"Add\"` to find any commits where the number of occurrences of \"Add\" within a file changes.\n\n![The output of `git log -S \"Add\"` finds a commit where the number of occurrences of \"Add\" changes within a file.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-S.png)\n\n- `git log --oneline --graph` - `--graph` Displays a visual representation of how the branches and commits were created in order to help you make sense of your repository history. When used alone, the description can be very lengthy, so you can combine the command with `--oneline` in order to shorten the description.\n\n![Git log --online --graph outputs a graphical representation of commits, showing where branches were created earlier and merged.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-log-oneline-graph.png)\n\n## Git commit amend\n\nGit’s `--amend` flag is extremely useful when updating a commit, it allows you to correct mistakes and edit commits easily instead of creating a completely new one. \n\nLet's say you finish working on a lengthy feature and everything seems to be working fine so you commit your work. Shortly after, you realize you missed a few semicolons in one of your functions. You could technically create a new commit, but ideally, you want to keep all commits specific, clean, and succinct. To avoid creating a new one, you could create your changes, stage them with `git add` and then type the command `git commit --amend` to update your previous commit. \n\nIt's important to note that although it seems like `--amend` is simply updating the commit, what Git actually does is replace the whole previous commit. For this reason, when you execute the command `git commit --amend`, your terminal editor asks  you to update your commit message:\n\n![git-amend](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/handy-git-operations/git-commit-amend.png)\n\nHowever, if you want to keep the same commit message, you can simply add the flag `--no-edit`:\n\n```\n$ git commit --amend --no-edit\n```\n\n## Git alias commands\nWhen grouping commands together, you can end up writing very long lines of Git commands in the terminal such as:\n\n```\n$ git log --pretty=format:\"%h %s\" --graph\n```\n\nFortunately, Git offers a helpful feature that can make your Git experience simpler, easier, and more familiar: aliases.\n\nIf you have a set of commands that you use regularly and want to save some time from typing them, you can easily set up an alias for each command using Git config.\n\nBelow are a couple of examples:\n\n\n```\n$ git config --global alias.co \"checkout\"\n$ git config --global alias.br \"branch\"\n$ git config --global alias.glop \"log --pretty=format:\"%h %s\" --graph\"\n```\n\nOnce the aliases are configured, next time you want to check out to another branch you could type the command:\n\n```\n$ git co example_branch\n```\n\nInstead of:\n\n```\n$ git checkout example_branch\n```\n\nUsing Git aliases can create a much more fluid and efficient workflow experience when using Git. By getting creative with your aliases, you're able to wrap a sequence of Git commands into one in order to save time and effort.\n","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"0ddf89185869cb4e33b94bdd15cb84c3","started":true,"startedAt":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","completed":true,"completedAt":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":"2024-04-25T16:51:26+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"Checkpoint:5c2fe5041d197249ab3908f1":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5041d197249ab3908f1","instructions":"You are in a Git project titled __hamlet-prince-of-denmark__.

It helps you manage and record your source code history. GitHub, on the other hand, is a hosting service for repositories. Simply put, Git is the tool and GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.\n\nIn this lesson we'll take a look at the basic workflow used with GitHub, which goes like this:\n\n1. Create a branch\n2. Commit changes\n3. Create a pull request\n4. Review pull request\n5. Merge and delete branch\n\nBy sticking to that workflow, team members are able to isolate their work and avoid any conflicting code from being merged.

With Git, each teammate can create their own branch off of the main project in order to work on bug-fixes, new features, experimental code, etc. \n\nA branch is essentially a divergence from the main project. ​​When you branch out, git is essentially making a new state of your current code, upon which you can work, without affecting the important main state of the code. One can create as many branches as they wish and even create branches off of other branches.\n\nBy using separate branches, the main project remains intact and unaffected before the changes are reviewed and  merged into the project. \n\nEach repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, is called `main`. The `main` branch is usually the working version of a project and contains the production code, so it's very important to only merge clean and correct code into it!\n\nWhen someone wants to create a new feature, fix a bug, or just experiment, they should always create their own branch with a descriptive name. \n\nEach team will adopt their own best practices when working together and figuring out naming conventions. For example, the branch name `carlos_feature_dashboard_notifications` includes the author, branch type, and short branch description. Other teams may pick branch names to correspond to ticket numbers from their project management tool.\n","instructions":null},"Exercise:74276cfe704a29ee62807d23c9e4a2f0":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"74276cfe704a29ee62807d23c9e4a2f0","sourceId":null,"title":"Managing Branches","slug":"managing-branches","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2021-10-28T18:59:04Z","checkpoints":[],"einConfig":{"container_type":"static-web","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2022-01-04T19:37:46Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:61d5d4496e81d6000fdccbb2"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":2.3291665},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"LayoutImage:61d49f3d5a19e7001c9a855a"},{"__ref":"Narrative:617af4ae75e9610018a29984"}]},"Workspace:61d6178f5a19e700169a8867":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"61d6178f5a19e700169a8867","slug":"blank-workspace","backendType":"static-web"},"LayoutImage:61d49fc30276cb000f76a238":{"__typename":"LayoutImage","id":"61d49fc30276cb000f76a238","type":"Image","imageUrl":"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-flow/github-flow-commit-changes.svg","altText":"commit changes"},"Narrative:617af4dc4380400012042d9d":{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"617af4dc4380400012042d9d","type":"Narrative","content":"Let's assume you were recently assigned to a team to develop a feature for an app. You clone (download) the entire app repository from GitHub, create a new branch from the `main` branch for your feature, and begin coding a new file in your local Git environment. \n\nAfter testing your code and ensuring that everything is running correctly, it's time to commit the changes and push them to the remote repository!\n\nAs a refresher, the `git commit` command records changes to one or more files in your branch, assigning the commit a unique ID that identifies who created the changes, what changes were made, and _when_ the changes were committed.\n\nAdd a commit message describing your work and finally, push the commit to the remote GitHub repository.","instructions":null},"Exercise:79be33a752d545876fbbafbb4d806781":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"79be33a752d545876fbbafbb4d806781","sourceId":null,"title":"Adding and Committing Changes ","slug":"adding-and-committing-changes","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2021-10-28T18:59:17Z","checkpoints":[],"einConfig":{"container_type":"static-web","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2022-01-05T22:11:24Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:61d6178f5a19e700169a8867"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.3},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"LayoutImage:61d49fc30276cb000f76a238"},{"__ref":"Narrative:617af4dc4380400012042d9d"}]},"Workspace:61d5d47b29505800258d8431":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"61d5d47b29505800258d8431","slug":"blank-workspace","backendType":"static-web"},"LayoutImage:61d4a0f9295058001c8d8360":{"__typename":"LayoutImage","id":"61d4a0f9295058001c8d8360","type":"Image","imageUrl":"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-flow/github-flow-open-pull-request.svg","altText":"open pull request"},"Narrative:617af5b485c821000ea06129":{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"617af5b485c821000ea06129","type":"Narrative","content":"At this point, your work is ready to be reviewed before it's integrated into the official project.

Specifically, we'll walk through creating your personal GitHub account, setting up Git on your computer, starting your first Git repository, and connecting that repository to a GitHub repository.\n\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you've completed the lessons on \u003ca href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLearn the Command Line\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLearn Git\u003c/a\u003e. Now, prepare to use those skills on your personal computer! If some steps in this tutorial are confusing, have no fear; it will all come together by the end.\n\n\n## What are Git and GitHub?\n\n\nThis tutorial refers to Git and GitHub repeatedly. *Git* is a widely-used version control system used to manage code. Git allows you to save drafts of your code so that you can look back at previous versions and potentially undo complicated errors. A project managed with Git is called a *Git repository*. \n\n\n*GitHub* is a popular hosting service for Git repositories. GitHub allows you to store your local Git repositories in the cloud. With GitHub, you can backup your personal files, share your code, and collaborate with others.\n\n\nIn short, GitHub is a tool for working with Git. There are other services to host Git repositories, but GitHub is a trusted, free service used by organizations across the world, big and small.\n\n\n## Create a GitHub Account\n\n\nTo use GitHub, you will need a GitHub account.\n\n\nIn your own browser:\n\n\n1. Open a new browser tab\n2. Navigate to \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://github.com/\u003c/a\u003e \n3. Create an account\n\n\nIf you already have a GitHub account, continue to the next exercise.\n\n\nAfter you sign up, you will receive a verification e-mail. Be sure to verify your e-mail address to GitHub by following the instructions in that e-mail.\n\n\n## Git Setup for Mac and Windows\n\n\nNext, we will set up Git on your personal computer. Follow the instructions for your operating system.\n\n\n### Mac users:\n\n\n1\\. Launch the **_Terminal_** application. You can find it in __/Applications/Utilities/__. You can also use the **_Spotlight_** search tool (the little magnifying glass in the top right of your screen) to search for **_Terminal_**. Once **_Spotlight_** locates it, click on the result that says **_Terminal_**.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n2\\. When **_Terminal_** opens, type in `git` and press enter.\n \n3\\. If you don't already have Git installed, a dialog will appear saying that \"The 'git' command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?\" Click \"Install\".\n\n![macInstall](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_prompt.png)\n\nThen click \"Agree to the Terms of Service\" when requested.\n\n![macAgree](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_terms.png)\n\n4\\. When the download finishes, the installer will go away on its own signifying that Git is now installed! Click \"Done\" to finish the installation process.\n\n![macDone](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_xcode_finished.png)\n\n\nNow skip down to the \"Final Setup\" section below to finish setting up.\n\n\n### Windows users:\n\n\nThis portion of the guide assumes you have already installed a program called Git Bash which allows us access to Git on Windows. If you have not installed Git Bash, please refer to the previous tutorial on Command Line Interface (CLI) Setup and follow the instructions for installing Git Bash on Windows. Once you complete that you can continue with this guide.\n\n1\\. Open the Start menu and search for the app, git bash. You should see ‘Git Bash Desktop app’ appear. Press Enter or click on the Git Bash icon to open the app.\n\n![gitBashOpen](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_start.png)\n\nA new window will open that looks like this:\n\n![gitBashShell](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_shell_edited.png)\n\nThis window is our CLI, where we will use our Git commands.\n\n2\\. If you want to make sure that Git is installed, run `git --version` in the CLI. You should see a response that gives you the version of Git installed. It will look like this:\n\n![gitVersion](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20bash%20setup/annotated_gitbash_test_edited.png)\n\nGit can now be used in the Git Bash app!\n\nContinue on to finish setting up.\n\n\n### Final Setup\n\n\n1. Navigate to GitHub's articles on setting up your \u003ca href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGit username\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eemail\u003c/a\u003e and follow the instructions for each using Git Bash. \n2. GitHub offers two authentication options, HTTPS and SSH, to keep your work secure. This is a security measure that prevents anyone who isn't authorized from making changes to your GitHub repository. In this article, we will use HTTPS. \n    * To authenticate yourself in the terminal, you will need to generate a _Personal Access Token_ on GitHub. Navigate to GitHub's article on [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) and follow the instructions for creating a classic token. Be sure to check the box that grants the token `repo` scope \u0026mdash; this will allow you to write to the repository from the terminal on your machine.\n    * Once you get the token, make sure to copy it or keep the page open \u0026mdash; you will not be able to view the token again once you navigate away from the page and you'll need it later in the instructions!\n\n\n## Try It Out!\n\n\nNow you have everything you need to practice your Git skills on your local computer. Take a moment to run the commands below to initialize a Git repository. We will use this Git repository again later in this tutorial so make sure you complete these steps exactly as described.\n\n\n1. `mkdir git_practice` to make a new directory to practice.\n2. `cd git_practice` to make the new directory your working directory.\n3. `git init` to turn the current, empty directory into a fresh Git repository.\n4. `echo \"Hello Git and GitHub\" \u003e\u003e README.txt` to create a new README file (more on this later) with some sample text.\n5. `git add README.txt` to add the new file to the Git staging area.\n6. `git commit -m \"First commit\"` to make your first commit with the new README file.\n\n\n## Your First Remote Repository on GitHub\n\n\nFinally, we'll create a repository on GitHub and then link it to a local repository on your computer. This allows you to backup your work constantly and safely, so you never need to worry about losing your work again!\n\n\nNow, let's connect our local Git repository to GitHub.\n\n\n### Instructions\n\n\n1\\. In your Command Line Interface, make sure your current working directory is your new Git repository. Navigate there if not.\n\n\n2\\. Check the status of which files and folders are new or have been edited. There should be no files modified.\n\n\n```\n$ git status\n```\n\n\n3\\. On GitHub, create a new repository by clicking the __New repository__ button on the home page. \n![newRepository](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_button.svg)\n\n4\\. On the new repository page, give your repository a name. It's not necessary, but it would be convenient to name it the same as the directory, **git_practice**. After naming the repository, click __Create repository__.\n![createRepository](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_creation.svg)\n\n\n5\\. After creating a repository, GitHub displays the repository page. At the top of the page, make sure \"HTTPS\" is selected.\n![githubHttps](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_https.svg)\n\n\n6\\.The repository is empty, so it's time to connect it to your existing work. Copy the Git commands on the GitHub page, under the title \"...or push an existing repository from the command line\", and paste them into your Command Line Interface. Running these commands will add a remote repository, and then push your local repository to the remote repository. \n\nWhen asked for a username and password, type in your GitHub username as the username and paste your personal access token as the password, pressing \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e (or \u003ckbd\u003ereturn\u003c/kbd\u003e) after each. Don't be alarmed if you can't see the characters you are typing, they are intentionally hidden as a security measure.\n![githubCommands](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/setup-git-github/new_repo_setup_push.svg)\n\n\n7\\. Once your Command Line Interface reports that the push is complete, refresh the page on GitHub. You should now see the text you wrote earlier in the README file, \"Hello Git and GitHub.\"\n\n\nGitHub automatically displays the contents of a file named **README.txt** if it exists in the repository. The README file is the perfect place to write a description of your project.\n\n\nThere you have it! Your first GitHub repository, linked to your local Git repository. You've taken some huge leaps, so be proud! Now you can use your knowledge of Git to track progress on your local computer and push that progress to GitHub whenever you want. You can rest easy knowing that each step of your progress is safely stored in GitHub.\n","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"74bb71f3f3d5998245e9bbef934502d9","started":true,"startedAt":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","completed":true,"completedAt":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":"2024-04-25T16:51:43+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"Article:a6c65e4516831c607a89421e8e12492e":{"__typename":"Article","id":"a6c65e4516831c607a89421e8e12492e","description":"Learn how to sign up for a GitHub account and share your code","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"what-is-github","title":"What is GitHub?","time":10,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What is GitHub?\n\nOne of the best ways to share what you've been learning with other people is to put your code on GitHub. GitHub is both a website and a service that facilitates software development by allowing you to store your code in containers, called _repositories_, and by tracking changes made to your code. In addition, it offers a hosting service and tools to build, test, and deploy code. \n\nGitHub uses [Git, a version-control development tool]( https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git), to manage your projects by tracking changes to files and allowing multiple people to work on the same project. Although both GitHub and Git have similar names, GitHub is a service, while Git is a development tool that can be used by you outside of and without GitHub. \n\n## Why is GitHub important?\n\nThere are many reasons why knowing about GitHub is important for your personal growth as a developer. A large part of the appeal of Github is the access it grants developers to the massive community of developers around the world who openly share their code, projects, and software development tools with each other. Therefore, if you want to continue working on your Git skills, creating your programming portfolio, or finding work, GitHub can help.  \n\n## How to Sign Up for an Account\n\nNow that you're aware of GitHub's benefits, you probably want to sign up for an account and try it out yourself. First, navigate to the home page of the GitHub website, [https://github.com](https://github.com). \n\nYou can click on the **Sign Up** button in the upper right corner or fill out your email and click on **Sign up for GitHub**, as highlighted in this screenshot: \n\n![Home page of the GitHub website with the **Sign Up** buttons highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-1-signup.png)\n\nYou’ll be taken to a page asking you to fill out your email. If you did so on the home page, it will already be filled out for you. If it isn’t filled out, enter the email you wish to use. \n\n![GitHub prompting for email with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-2-email.png)\n\nPick an email that you're comfortable sharing with peers and potential hires. Because of the way Git works, it's important to note that your email can be exposed publicly when you make a pull request or merge in code to a repository, making it visible to anyone looking through your projects. When you sign up for a new GitHub account, your email address is hidden by default.  \n\nOnce you have an email entered, click on “continue.” GitHub will then ask you to create a password. Fill out a password for your new account. \n\n![GitHub prompting for password with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-3-password.png)\n\nWhen you click on “continue,” GitHub will then ask you for a username. Fill out the user name you would like to use (you may need to try a few times to find one that’s available). \n\n![GitHub prompting for user name with **Continue** button highlighted](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/Image-4-username.png)\n\nLike with email addresses, when choosing a username, it's wise to choose one you wouldn't mind future employers or colleagues seeing. A combination of your first and last name, like `firstnamelastname`, or using initials, like `i_lastname`, are good because they make it easy to find you on GitHub or identify you when you make [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) or [reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). Remember, you're likely using this account to share or access code. \n\nAlso be aware that usernames are first come, first serve and may not be available if someone else already claimed the username. Additionally, usernames may only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens are not allowed at the beginning or end. \n\nAfter you click on “continue,” GitHub will prompt to ask if you want to receive product updates and announcements. Make your selection and click “continue,” again. GitHub will then prompt you to solve a puzzle to prove you’re a human being. Click on “Verify” to view the puzzle. \n\nOnce you submit the solution to the puzzle, a “Create Account” button will appear. Click on it and GitHub will prompt you for an 8-digit code. GitHub will send you the code to the email you entered earlier. Enter the code from the email and GitHub will create your account.  \n\n## Settings\n\nOnce your account is created, GitHub will ask a couple of questions to personalize your experience. Fill these out or click on the “skip personalization” link at the bottom of the page. \n\nYou should now see a personal dashboard with a section for your projects and some messages: \n\n![GitHub personal dashboard](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-is-github/image-5-dashboard.png)\n\nNow you have your own GitHub account! You can continue to customize your account by:\n\n+ [setting your email to private](https://github.blog/2017-04-11-private-emails-now-more-private/) \n\n+ [setting up two-factor authentication](https://github.blog/2013-09-03-two-factor-authentication/)\n\nThat's it; you now have your very own GitHub account. 🎉\n\n## Recap\n\nWith more people working remotely and with teams distributed across different countries and time zones, GitHub and Git can be valuable tools for collaborating on projects. You can also use GitHub to work on any file-based project, such as writing documentation. \n\nLet's review what you did in this article:\n\n+ Learned that GitHub is both a website and service for storing and sharing code\n+ Learned that GitHub uses Git to facilitate software development by tracking changes\n+ Created your own GitHub account\n+ Enabled security features like keeping your email private and turning on two-factor authentication\n\n## Going Further\n\nOnce you feel comfortable navigating GitHub, consider doing the following:\n\n+ [Add information about yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile) in your profile, including an avatar, bio, location, etc.\n+ [Set your status](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile#setting-a-status) in your profile to let people know what you're doing.\n+ If you feel comfortable enough with Git, you can take a look at [this article on GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), GitHub's hosting service that allows you to create a personal website, \"project site\", based on a repository to make your portfolio site.\n+ If you're interested in paid accounts, GitHub has a [pricing page](https://github.com/pricing) with various types of accounts and features you can look at.\n\nShow the world what you can do with your code!","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"a6c65e4516831c607a89421e8e12492e","started":true,"startedAt":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","completed":true,"completedAt":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":"2024-04-25T16:51:36+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"MultipleChoice:6197d3ef6cf8ac00228d381b":{"__typename":"MultipleChoice","id":"6197d3ef6cf8ac00228d381b","type":"multiple_choice","prompt":"What is the name of the starting branch when creating a new GitHub repository?","correctAnswer":0,"answers":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`main`","reason":"Correct!

Markdown?","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## Introduction\nIf you are looking for a simple way to create visually appealing text documents without using any fancy editors, check out [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Invented by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004, Markdown provides a lightweight syntax to style any text document so that it can be converted to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) for viewing and publishing.\n\n## Differences between HTML and Markdown\n\nMarkdown translates to HTML, but Markdown is not a replacement for HTML. Markdown’s syntax can be converted to a small subset of HTML tags to do things like format text, add links, display images, and more. You can even incorporate HTML elements inside a Markdown document. To render Markdown in HTML, though, you would need a tool called a Markdown parser (more about this parser later on).\n\n## Benefits of Using Markdown\n\nWhy would you use Markdown? Compared to HTML, writing text in Markdown is much faster because the syntax is simpler. The [authors of Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) intended Markdown to be a language for writing styled text with syntax that is just as easy to read as it is to write. \n\nImagine that we are writing down some important text on a sheet of paper. If we wanted to emphasize the text we might underline it, twice even! Similarly, in Markdown, we could write:\n\n```\nTitle of My Document\n====================\n```\n\nNotice that we have plain text that has a row of equal signs (`=`) to produce a first-level header, also known as `\u003ch1\u003e`. On a webpage, the heading will display as such:\n\nTitle of My Document\n====================\n\nThe amount of `=`s don't matter so long as there's at least one and it goes under the text. \n\nFor text that's important, but not as important as a first-level heading, we might just underline it once. In code, we could use a row of hyphens (`-`), like so:\n\n```\nSub-Title of My Document\n------------------------\n```\n\nto produce a second-level header, also known as `\u003ch2\u003e`:\n\nSub-Title of My Document\n------------------------\n\nBoth examples are valid Markdown syntax. It is intuitive and normal for headings to be in either format. Alternatively, you can format headings using the `#` character. We'll show more examples of different headings, but for now, here's an example of valid syntax for a `\u003ch1\u003e` heading:\n\n```\n# Title of My Document\n```\n\nFurthermore, a Markdown document without any HTML tags can be published as is because its syntax is already made for easy viewing.  For example, the following Markdown document has: \n* styled a heading underlined with equal signs (`=`),\n* emphasized `week` in bold with double asterisks (`**`), \n* bulleted a list by prefacing each item with a number and a period, \n* and marked several lines as separate quotes with an angle bracket (`\u003e`) per quote. \n\n```\nMy Todo List\n============\n\nAt the end of this **week**, I plan to:\n\n1. Learn Markdown\n2. Write Markdown\n3. Share a Markdown note\n\nMy favorite quote is:\n\u003e If you didn't get it the first time\n\u003e Do not despair\n\u003e Try and try again\n\u003e ~ Anonymous\n```\n\nThe HTML equivalent to the above would be:\n```html\n\u003ch1\u003eMy Todo List\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of this \u003cstrong\u003eweek\u003c/strong\u003e, I plan to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLearn Markdown\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWrite Markdown\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eShare a Markdown note\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite quote is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    If you didn't get it the first time\u003cbr\u003e\n    Do not despair\u003cbr\u003e\n    Try and try again\u003cbr\u003e\n    ~ Anonymous\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n```\n\nWhen viewed on a Markdown parser such as [Stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#), you will see this:\n![Markdown Rendering on Stackedit.io](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/What-is-Markdown/stack_edit_md_parser.jpg)\n\nor this, based on Codecademy's parser:\n\nMy Todo List\n==========\n\nAt the end of this **week**, I plan to:\n\n1. Learn Markdown\n2. Write Markdown\n3. Share a Markdown note\n\nMy favorite quote is:\n\u003e If you didn't get it the first time\n\u003e Do not despair\n\u003e Try and try again\n\u003e ~ Anonymous\n\nWhile both parsers take the same Markdown input, they render slightly different HTML based on their internal configuration and CSS.\n\n## When to Use Markdown\n\nAfter knowing the many benefits of Markdown, you might want to consider using Markdown if you ever find yourself in any of these scenarios:\n\n* The only editor available to you supports just plain text.\n* Time is of the essence and you can't afford to learn how to use an unfamiliar rich-text editor.\n* You need to quickly outline your ideas in a structured but presentable manner.\n* You want your document to be portable so that it can convert to HTML, PDF, EPUB, and/or MOBI.\n\n## Markdown Document Extension\n\nContrary to popular belief, Markdown is not a document format. Therefore, it doesn't require a strict file extension naming convention, such as **.md**.  As the [official Markdown mailing list](https://superuser.com/questions/249436/file-extension-for-markdown-files) explains, Markdown isn't meant to take over the format of a file. Any file extension that you would normally use to name your text document such as **.txt** or **.text** is appropriate. However, organizations such as [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) have a preference to expect Markdown documents to appear with an **.md** or **.markdown** extension.\n\n## Markdown Applications\n\nSince Markdown has gained a lot of popularity, you will find Markdown content being accepted in many applications. \n\n* Website publishers that accept Markdown content include [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/support/can-i-use-markdown-on-wordpress-com), [Ghost](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/ghost/) and [BeakerBrowser](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/guides/create-a-markdown-site). Tools such as [Jekyll](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/), [Docusaurus](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/docusaurus/) and [MkDocs](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/mkdocs/) can convert Markdown documents into a static website geared for technical documentation.  Take a look at this [page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) rendered in HTML, and its text [source](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics.text) styled in Markdown.\n\n* Book publishers such as [LeanHub](http://help.leanpub.com/en/articles/2941344-leanpub-flavoured-markdown-vs-markua-for-writing-in-plain-text) accepts Markdown manuscripts and convert them to books for publication.\n\n* Slide-show presentations such as [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/) and [Cleaver](https://jdan.github.io/cleaver/#2) can convert Markdown slides into HTML for web viewing.\n\n## The Markdown Parser\n\nA Markdown parser is software written to parse the Markdown syntax in a text document and convert it to HTML syntax. The original Markdown parser was written in Perl, but you can find parser [implementations](https://github.com/markdown/markdown.github.com/wiki/Implementations) today in almost any programming language. Regardless, a basic Markdown parser should support the [core Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics):  paragraphs, headers, blockquotes, phrase emphasis, lists, code, images, and links.\n\nThere are Markdown parsers that are freely available on the Web: [StackEdit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#), [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io), [Parse](https://parsedown.org/demo) and [Markdown to HTML Converter](https://markdowntohtml.com/). In addition to parsing and rendering, both Parse and Markdown to HTML Converter also convert the Markdown document to raw HTML so that you can copy and paste the HTML to be used elsewhere.\n\n## Markdown Tutorial\n\nLet's learn a little more about the Markdown syntax. As mentioned above, you can simulate a `\u003ch1\u003e` HTML tag with a `#` Markdown symbol. Since there are six heading tags for HTML, from `\u003ch1\u003e` through `\u003ch6\u003e`, you can simulate this with `#` through `######` in Markdown. For example this Markdown syntax:\n\n```\n# This is a H1 heading\n## This is a H2 heading\n### This is a H3 heading\n#### This is a H4 heading\n##### This is a H5 heading\n###### This is a H6 heading\n```\n\nwill render this:\n\n# This is a H1 heading\n## This is a H2 heading\n### This is a H3 heading\n#### This is a H4 heading\n##### This is a H5 heading\n###### This is a H6 heading\n\n\nIn addition to numbered lists, you can style a bulleted list too.  There are three different symbols you can use to mark a line item as a bullet: asterisk (`*`), plus sign (`+`), or hyphen (`-`).\n\nFor example:\n```\n* Markdown\n+ HTML\n- XML\n```\n\nproduces this:\n\n* Markdown\n+ HTML\n- XML\n\nFor best practice, it is recommended to use the same marker throughout your list instead of mixing them like above.\n\nThe core Markdown syntax does not include nested lists (list within another list), but it allows adding paragraphs between list items. To do so, you need to add a blank line after a list item and indent 4 spaces or 1 tab before starting a paragraph. Some parsers are lenient and do not enforce 4 spaces but there should be some spacing.\n\n```\n* Markdown\n\n   Markdown is a lightweight markup language for styling text.\n\n* HTML\n\n   HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.\n```\n\nFor more examples of basic syntax, check out [CommonMark's reference guide](https://commonmark.org/help/).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"5fdb8d6a1b7dc10012ee9d2f\" /\u003e\n\n\n## The Markdown Flavors\n\nBecause the core Markdown language supports only a subset of HTML features, many independent developers have extended the Markdown syntax to incorporate more HTML compatibilities and customize it for their own organizations. Here are a few popular flavors of Markdown:\n\n+ [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) is a body of special-interest developers who work side-by-side on a proposal to standardize the Markdown syntax and offer extensive test suites to validate Markdown implementations against this specification. This standard has been used by other developers to base their code upon.\n\n+ GitHub Flavored Markup, or [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is GitHub's expanded dialect of Markdown based on CommonMark and is used throughout the GitHub platform by its active community.\n\n+ [Trello](https://help.trello.com/article/821-using-markdown-in-trello), a popular collaborative tool that organizes and tracks information through virtual boards and cards, implements a custom version of Markdown as well.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou've learned a lot about Markdown, specifically: \n\n+ What Markdown is and how it differs from HTML\n+ How you can benefit from Markdown \n+ Where and when to apply Markdown in various scenarios \n+ How to write Markdown to style your text and make it presentable \n+ What a Markdown parser is and where to locate one \n+ Where to find other flavors of Markdown that are used in industry \n\nAmazing job getting this far! Don't be shy in applying Markdown in your next document. In fact, this article and many others like this on Codecademy were prepared using Markdown! See? We practice what we preach.\n\n\n","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"6fba6601220e1b9657e11e44908b106d","started":true,"startedAt":"2024-04-25T17:12:43+00:00","completed":true,"completedAt":"2024-04-25T17:12:43+00:00","userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":"2024-04-25T17:12:43+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"Article:702044f78479af3df3ceb1baecf449aa":{"__typename":"Article","id":"702044f78479af3df3ceb1baecf449aa","description":"External article for learning Markdown.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"ext-art-mastering-markdown","title":"Mastering Markdown","time":10,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"→ **[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)**\n\nIn this article, you will learn how to use Markdown for styling text on the web, such as creating links and adding code blocks.

As implied in its name, a [README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) file is a text file that is meant to be read as soon as someone views the repository. This file contains text to introduce, explain, and share the information required to understand what the project is about.\n\n![Comic with three panels in which a character clones a GitHub project, gets confused trying to use it, and finally realizes after three hours that there’s a README file explaining all of the steps](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/write-README/github-README.svg)\n\nSince a README file is often the first thing a visitor sees, it should tell the viewer how to install and use the project. There is no one good way to structure a README but there is only one bad way: not to include a README at all.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"618c2dd22e75b70021b69d57\" /\u003e\n\n## Conventions of a Good README File\nYour README file should be as good as your project itself. \n\nMake your project stand out and look professional by at least including the following elements in your README:\n- **Project Title**: the name of your project\n- **Description**: This is an extremely important component of the README. You should describe the main purpose of your project. Answer questions like “why did you build this project?” and “what problem(s) does it solve?”. It also helps to include your motivations for the project and what you learned from it.\n- **Features**: If your project has multiple features, list them here. Don’t be afraid to brag if your project has unique features that make it stand out. You can even add screenshots and gifs to show off the features.\n- **How to use**: Here, you should write step-by-step instructions on how to install and use your project. Any software or package requirements should also be listed here.\n- **Technologies**: List all the technologies and/or frameworks you used and what purpose they serve in your project.\n- **Collaborators**: If others have contributed to your project in any way, it is important to give them credit for their work. Write your team members’ or collaborators’ names here along with a link to their GitHub profile.\n- **License**: It’s also important to list a license on your README so other developers can understand what they can and cannot do with your project. You can use [this guide](https://choosealicense.com/) to help you choose a license.\n\nKeep READMEs brief but detailed. README should always be up-to-date and self-explanatory. If you have spent a lot of time on your project, you should also spend a good chunk of time on the README. It can help your future self as well when you step away for a while and need to get reacquainted with your project. Not to mention it'll leave a positive impression on future interviewers who look at your GitHub profile.\n\n## Using Markdown to Format READMEs\nKeep in mind that nobody wants to read a long block of unformatted text bloated with information. That is why a README file usually has the `.md` extension. Formatting README files with Markdown can give them flair and make them interesting to read.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"5f3b4f656caaba00183ea90f\" /\u003e\n\n### Use Headers\nEvery title or section (usage, license, etc.) in a README.md should be formatted as a header. Using headers and adding some HTML, we can achieve stuff like this: \n\n\u003cdiv style=\"background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green;\"\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e📕 Codecademy Docs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDocumentation for popular programming languages and frameworks.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBuilt by the community. Maintained by Codecademy.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003e What are Docs? \u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n[Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs) is a free, easily accessible reference for coding terms and concepts, available to developers all over the world.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTake a look at the README file on [Codecademy’s docs repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs) for the source code.\n\nGitHub uses headers to automatically generate a table of contents for README files based on the Markdown sections. Something like this\n```\n## Usage\nPlease follow these steps to get your application up and running.\n\n### Requirements\nThe following packages are required for this script to work.\n- pandas\n- numpy\n- requests\n\nTo install these packages, you can simply run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n```\n\nGitHub will find the headers and include them in a table of contents based on the header hierarchy:\n\n![An image of a README on GitHub showing a table of contents for the project called \"My Awesome Project\". The headers include \"What does it do?\", \"Usage\" with a \"Requirements\" subsection, and \"License\".](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/write-README/table-of-contents.png)\n\n### Level Up READMEs With Media\nDocumentation doesn’t have to be boring. Go for images or videos to make a project more understandable and appealing! We can add the project’s logo, diagrams, screenshots, or even GIFs!\n\nFor Markdown files living in a repository, the path to the image can either be to an URL or to an image file in the repository. For example, if we had an image named `diagram.png` inside the `images` folder of the repository, we could reference it like so `![Use Case Diagram](./images/diagram.png)` in the **README.md**.\n\n## Conclusion\nWrite engaging READMEs! Make sure they include easy-to-follow details for your project. This improves your documentation skills and makes you a better developer and communicator of code.\n\nIf you want to see more examples of good READMEs, take a look at the README on Codecademy’s [40Phaser](https://github.com/Codecademy/40Phaser) and [stuff.js](https://github.com/Codecademy/stuff.js) repositories. For more information on GitHub’s formatting syntax, take a look at their [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"618c33656bed47001407e36d\" /\u003e\n","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"afc520cf3a2b03f07640e23ceae8f5ac","started":true,"startedAt":"2024-04-25T17:13:10+00:00","completed":true,"completedAt":"2024-04-25T17:13:10+00:00","userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":"2024-04-25T17:13:10+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"Informational:c5aebcf47a15a2dae91ce28d3b203a9c":{"__typename":"Informational","id":"c5aebcf47a15a2dae91ce28d3b203a9c","description":null,"isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"github-markdown","title":"GitHub and Markdown","time":3,"type":"informational","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"Why learn Markdown?\n\nOnce we add our code to GitHub, how do we actually format the text in our repository?\n\nTechnically, we could use plaintext on everything.

We'll use a service called GitHub Pages to share our web page creations on the World Wide Web.\n\n\n## What is GitHub Pages?\n\n\nThere are many different ways to deploy a website to the public Internet. We'll be using GitHub's free service called GitHub Pages.\n\n\nWhy GitHub Pages? GitHub Pages offers a lot of features and flexibility, all for free. Some of the benefits include:\n\n\n* Easy setup\n* Seamless collaboration using Git and GitHub\n* Free hosting with \u003e95% uptime\n* Live updating with normal GitHub workflow\n\n\n## What is Deploying?\n\n\nDeploying is like publishing. When authors are ready for their work to be seen by the world, they publish it. When web developers are ready to share their projects, they deploy to the World Wide Web. Deployment is when a project is packaged and shared on the Internet. Unlike publishing, however, deployment may occur many, many times over the course of a software project.\n\n\n## Deployment on GitHub Pages\n\nDeploying to GitHub Pages is automatic. Once it's set up, deploying happens whenever you push your local changes to your remote, GitHub-hosted repository. Head to GitHub Pages' \u003ca href=\"https://pages.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esetup instructions\u003c/a\u003e and follow the steps exactly to get your main GitHub Pages page setup.\n\nWhen you first navigate to your newly deployed site it is possible that you will receive a 404 error. If this happens, and you are confident that you have followed all the steps as written, check back in 30 minutes to see if the deploy has successfully gone through.\n\n## Viewing Your Live Web Page\n\n\nThat's it! Your website is deployed to the Internet! You and anyone with whom you share this link can view your project by navigating in your browser to the URL `http://\u003cyour-github-username\u003e.github.io`.\n\n## Adding GitHub Pages Projects\n\nYou can set up your GitHub Pages to deploy every one of your repositories in addition to `\u003cusername\u003e.github.io`. This will allow you to ensure all of your sites are deployed automatically whenever you push to GitHub.\n\nIn GitHub, navigate to your `\u003cusername\u003e.github.io` repository and click __Settings__.\n![githubSettings](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20setup/githubsettings.png)\n\nWithin __Settings__, navigate to the __Source__ section within the __Github Pages__ section. From the dropdown menu, select __master branch__ and then click __Save__.\n![githubPagesSection](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-3/git%20setup/githubpagessection.png)\n\nNow, all of your repositories can be found at `http://\u003cusername\u003e.github.io/\u003crepository-name\u003e`. Try creating a new repo with an HTML project inside it (perhaps push an old project to GitHub) and then navigate to the deployed page.\n\n## Deploying New Changes\n\nNow that your GitHub Pages site is set up, deploying new changes is easy. Every time you make a change to your site, use the normal GitHub flow. That is, use `git commit` and `git push` to send your changes to GitHub. After this, the GitHub site should update within a few seconds. Just refresh the page in your browser, and you're good to go!\n\nCongratulations on your first live web page!","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"6751c087006ec49fecbc2685310a8a79","started":true,"startedAt":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","completed":true,"completedAt":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":"2024-04-25T23:12:40+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"Article:62ae76d76f6f4321fb7eae061d54cb85":{"__typename":"Article","id":"62ae76d76f6f4321fb7eae061d54cb85","description":"In the following project, you will practice the commands associated with Git Rebase.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"github-rebase-off-platform-project","title":"Git Rebase Off-Platform Project","time":20,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"As a refresher, the Git rebase functionality helps branches keep up to date with the most recent changes in the main branch. We get a more linear history in the repository after rebasing. In this project, you will help two friends with their project of transcribing a story onto a GitHub repository.\n\nLet’s start with a bit of back story; Viraj and Noah collaborate to transcribe the children’s story of “The Little Black Fish” and store the text in a Github repository. They have broken the story into two parts, with Viraj working on part 1 while Noah types part 2. They track their progress in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/practice-rebase-off-platform-project)\n\nThey decided to work on separate branches to avoid conflicts in case there is any overlap. Viraj works in a branch named `part_1_Monday`, and Noah tracks his contributions in `part_2_Monday`. The main branch follows the most recent approved and merged work.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase-project/little-black-fish-two-branches.png\" alt=\"Screenshot: in the terminal, Git shows the most recent history of commits on the main branch.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nViraj and Noah started working on Monday and made some progress on their parts. They committed and pushed changes to their feature branches, `part_1_Monday` and `part_2_Monday`, respectively.\n\nNoah ends the day by creating a pull request and merging his changes to the `main` branch of the repository. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase-project/little-black-fish-two-branches-merge-changes.png\" alt=\"Similar to the commit history in the last screenshot, except the history now shows that changes from part_1_Monday were merged into main.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNote that both `main` and `part_2_Monday` track the same progress and `part_1_Monday` tracks its isolated progress while staying behind from the most recent changes. So let’s help Viraj keep his branch up to date with the most recent changes using the git rebase command. Please note that Viraj could alternatively pull origin main and merge the changes into his branch if he didn't care about maintaining all the interim commits. Nevertheless, we will proceed with rebasing to maintain the commits. \n\nLet's see if you can help them rebase the repository! [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/practice-rebase-off-platform-project) to your Github account and clone it onto your local computer. Make sure the input labeled \"Copy the `main` branch only\" is _unselected_ when you fork the repository \u0026mdash; otherwise, it won't copy the branches that Viraj and Noah are working in! Next, open a terminal and change your current directory to the directory of the local repository and visually observe the state of the branches: \n\n```\n\u003e git checkout part_1_Monday\n\u003e git pull\n\u003e git checkout part_2_Monday\n\u003e git pull\n```\n\nYou can use the following Git command to see a fuller picture of commits and progresses made in the branches: \n\n```\n\u003e git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all\n```\n\nNow, check out Viraj’s branch: \n\n```\n\u003e git checkout part_1_Monday\n```\n\nAnd rebase Viraj’s branch with `main`: \n\n```\n\u003e git rebase main\n```\nNotice that the `The Little Black Fish - Part 2` file in Viraj’s branch is updated with Noah’s changes. \n\nObserve the new state of the branches, visually: \n\n```\n\u003e git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all\n```\n## Walkthrough\n\nIf you need any more guidance to complete this project, we have a project walkthrough video for you:\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/85Lx8s_i4Yk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\nIn this tutorial, you applied `git rebase` in a repository.

It allows multiple people to work on the same project from anywhere. However, that doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of what GitHub has to offer. In this article, we will explore settings to customize our GitHub repository as well as discuss features that will take our repository to the next level.\n\nAll GitHub settings can be accessed by clicking the **Settings** tab on the main page of our repository. You can follow along with this article by opening your own repository settings!\n\n![A screenshot of a GitHub repository's settings tabs: General, Collaborators, Security \u0026 analysis, Branches, Webhooks, Notifications, Integrations, Deploy keys, Actions, Secrets, Pages](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/managing-a-github-repo/image-2-settings-menu.png)\n\n### The General Tab \n\nThe General tab allows us to change the basic repository information, such as its name and social media banner. It is where we can set a default branch. The default branch is the branch against which all pull requests and code commits are automatically made (typically this is already set to the `main` branch). \n\nIt’s also where we can enable or disable certain GitHub features like Wikis, Issues, Discussions, and more. We can also change merge options to only allow certain types of merges or automatically delete head branches. Most importantly, there’s the danger zone. \n\n#### The Danger Zone\n\n![A screenshot showing The Danger Zone in the Options tab of a GitHub repository's settings page.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/managing-a-github-repo/image-3-danger-zone.png)\n\nAs the name suggests, the danger zone is where one should take caution when changing settings. We can make a repository private or public, transfer ownership to another user, and archive or delete the repository.\n\n## Managing Collaborators \n\nBy default, only the owner of the repository or the organization can configure the settings of a repository and access the tools. We have to go through the repository settings’ Collaborators tab to grant other users or teams access. The specificity of permissions differs greatly between a user repository and an organization repository. \n\nAs always, we should use caution when granting permissions, especially to those outside of our immediate organization or team. They can make undesired changes to the code, host pages or packages on our behalf, or even leak private source code. \n\n### User Repository\n\nFor a user repository, the owner can easily add another user by clicking the “Add people” button and searching for their full name, email address, or username. The user will then have to accept the invitation. While the added user doesn’t have the same permissions as the owner of the repository, the user can still rename a branch and publish packages, among other things. For more information on the differences between the permission levels, check out [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository).\n\n![A screenshot showing the Manage Access tab of a GitHub repository's settings page. It shows a private user repository with four GitHub users added as collaborators.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/manage-repo/manage-access-collaborators.png)\n\n### Organization Repository\n\nGitHub Organizations provide its members a way to collaborate on multiple projects across multiple repositories. Owners or administrators of the organization can manage member access to the organization’s repositories. Adding a member to a repository is no different from the process in a user repository, with the exception of adding teams. In a GitHub Organization, admins can group members into teams and reference users by team names. You can read more about organization roles and their varying abilities on the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization).\n\n![A screenshot showing the Manage Access tab of a GitHub repository's settings page. It shows an organization repository with the organization members given different roles. The \"Admins\" team and a user are given the Write permission, and the \"Core\" team members, as well as one additional member, is given the Admin permission.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/manage-repo/organization-repo.png)\n\n#### Repository Roles\n\nBusinesses and institutions usually have a hierarchy that defines levels of authority and responsibilities. The same principles can be applied in a GitHub repository or organization; we don't want everyone to have admin privileges. Plus, it's strategic and secure to map levels of access. \n\nYou can check out [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) for a detailed breakdown of permissions for repository roles. You can also read about [creating custom repository roles](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization) to have a configurable set of permissions with a role name of your choice.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"619c4a7ce97f91001cea64e8\" /\u003e\n\n## Other Repository Features and Tools\n\nSo far, we've already discussed the GitHub features we will be using most of the time. However, GitHub has a ton of advanced tools and settings we should definitely take advantage of. While we will not be diving deep into these, we still want you to be aware of them so you can revisit them when the need arises. Each of the following features has a dedicated tab in the GitHub repository settings:\n\n- **Code Security \u0026 Analysis**: We can enable or disable a variety of security features for our repository. \n- [**Webhooks**](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks): We can use webhooks to get notifications when certain events happen. \n- **Email Notifications**: We can receive email notifications when push events are triggered. \n- **GitHub Apps**: Any open-source applications we use to extend our GitHub workflow or any third-party tools we integrate with GitHub will appear here. For example, Slack or CircleCI. \n- [**Deploy Keys**](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys): We can use the SSH keys generated here to grant servers access to a repository for deployment. \n- **Actions**: [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a powerful tool to automate, customize, and execute software workflows such as testing  The [Actions tab](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository) allows us to change the permissions. \n- **Secrets and variables**: Secrets are encrypted environment variables that can be used in Actions. \n- **Pages**: GitHub [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows us to host simple web pages straight from the repository. \n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"619c4c167ff745001cce9784\" /\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongrats on completing this article! It’s important to realize that GitHub is more than just a source code management tool. It has the ability to run tests on our code, host simple web pages, emulate our team hierarchy to designate permissions based on role, and much more! This is why we should spend time understanding and configuring all of the options available to us when creating a repository. Doing so will streamline our workflow and increase our productivity, making us happier developers at the end of the day.\n","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"8d5a88da1bfe107f6d654ff010fa34fc","started":false,"startedAt":null,"completed":false,"completedAt":null,"userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":null,"record":null}},"Article:966238249099bf86b1912f1bf87bfb01":{"__typename":"Article","id":"966238249099bf86b1912f1bf87bfb01","description":"This article explains what pull requests are, how to structure them to be concise, and why it’s important to do so.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"how-to-write-a-good-pull-request","title":"How To Write a Good Pull Request","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"## What Is a Pull Request?\nSonia, a new member of Codecademy’s engineering team, has just finished a snazzy navigation menu on a branch titled, “sonia_feature_navigation_menu”. Her changes will not be merged to the main branch until her pull request is approved. A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a feature of GitHub and other source code management tools to review code before merging it from one branch to another, usually the main branch.\n\nWhen Sonia creates a new pull request, her repository will automatically be set as the source repository and the project’s repository will be set as the destination repository. She will get the option to specify the source branch and the destination branch. She will be greeted with a preview of the changes between the two codebases and whether the branches can be merged automatically depending on code conflicts. In the Pull Request description field, Sonia must describe the code changes and what feature(s) this merge will add to the main branch.\n\n![An image showing that the sonia_feature_navigation_menu branch cannot be merged automatically into the main branch when comparing the two branches](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/branch-comparison.png)\n\nSonia’s proposed changes can then be accepted or rejected by her teammates. Each pull request has its own discussion forum, creating a place for collaborators to leave feedback. They will review Sonia’s code, suggest what should be removed or changed, and how her code can be simplified or improved. Any further commits Sonia makes to the source branch will automatically be reflected in the pull request. Once her changes are accepted by the project’s collaborators, her branch can be merged into the repository’s main branch. GitHub will keep this pull request in history as a record of the code change, Sonia’s contribution, and the discussion that took place.\n\nThis pull request process is not only a way to increase group knowledge or improve product quality but also an exceptional way to develop professional skills through group critique. Next, we will discuss how to write a good pull request.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61833ec19862e9000f9a8eb4\" /\u003e\n\n## How To Make a Good Pull Request\nCreating a pull request to present your work for feedback can be intimidating. We will dive into how to structure a pull request in a clear way that makes it easier for the author and the reviewers to discuss code changes.\n\n![A screenshot of \"Open a pull request page\" on GitHub.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/pull-request.png)\n\n### Follow a Pull Request Structure – What, Why, and How?\nConcisely explain the purpose of the pull request in the title. If the pull request adds a new feature, go for something like “Add frontend component for settings page”. If it’s to fix a typo, be specific and say “Fix name typos on the Contact Us page”.\n\nThe description is where all the juicy details are. You want the reviewers to know the thought process behind code changes and the options you have considered. It also helps to embed screenshots, GIFs, or even videos of your application so reviewers can anticipate what the code change in the pull request looks like.\n\nSome developers even have preconfigured templates or checklists on their repositories to ensure all pull requests contain just the relevant information. Following these guidelines help speed up collaborative critiques so the code can get merged faster!\n\n### Make Commit Messages Clear and Use Comments\nEven having self-explanatory commit messages and comments in the code makes reviewers’ jobs much easier. Consider the commit message, “OMG! It finally worked” versus the message, “Fix typos: add missing @ symbols in emails”. Moreover, adding comments in the code is always a good practice to help other developers understand the function of specific lines. It helps the reviewer in this case!\n\nOne feature of GitHub pull requests on the web interface is the ability to add discussion comments to any single line of code or chunk of code. This allows separation of concerns over multiple discussions.\n\n![A comment by a reviewer on a line of code: \"Let's make these variables lower-cased \u0026 snake-cased\"](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/what-makes-good-pull-request/comment.png)\n\n### Keep Pull Requests Small and Fast\nReduce the size of pull requests and respond to reviews quickly. Splitting big features into smaller parts is the best way to speed up review time.

We want to be careful that `git add` doesn't accidentally move them to the staging area. That’s where a **.gitignore** file comes in. **.gitignore** is a plain text file that tells Git to intentionally ignore changes in certain files. This also ensures that no other contributor in the repository accidentally commits those files.\n\n## Why use a .gitignore file?\n\nEach line in **.gitignore** corresponds to a file, directory, or pattern we would like to ignore when staging. Using a **.gitignore** file results in cleaner staging areas and prevent files containing sensitive information from being committed. Some of the files or folders we should ignore include:\n- Configuration files with API or secret keys such as **.env**\n- Compiled binary files or production directories such as **build** or **dist**\n- Log files\n- Dependencies downloaded from a package manager such as **node_modules**\n- System files such as **thumbs.db** on Windows or **.DS_Store** on macOS\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12d11155fec0025fe8568\" /\u003e\n\n### .gitignore in action\n\nLet's say we run `git status` and see that operating system files, such as **thumbs.db** and **.DS_Store**, are staged and will be committed!\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the result of running the command \"git status\". The result shows all files are staged to be committed including the operating system files such as \"thumbs.db\" and \".DS_Store\".](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/add-file-before-gitignore.png)\n\nLet’s ignore those files using their exact names. For example, if we add these lines to our **.gitignore** file:\n```\n# Windows OS file\nthumbs.db\n\n# macOS OS file\n.DS_Store\n```\n\nGit will ignore the special operating system files for Windows and macOS. These files will never be committed for this particular repository regardless of their location in this project. Note that in the file, blank lines are ignored and lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.\n\nAfter unstaging and running `git add .` again, the output of `git status` shows that the **thumbs.db** and **.DS_Store** files have been ignored!\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the result after running the command \"git status\" again. The result shows all files that are staged to be committed but this time, the operating system files such as \"thumbs.db\" and \".DS_Store\" are not staged thanks to .gitignore.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/add-file-gitignore.png)\n\nLet's go over how to write a file yourself!\n\n## Creating a .gitignore File\nWe can create a **.gitignore** file easily using a terminal editor like `nano` or `emacs`, or just using a File explorer. Don't forget the `.` before the filename!\n\n**.gitignore** is usually placed in the root directory of the repository. The filenames inside a **.gitignore** file can be written relative to the location of the **.gitignore** file. For example, we could add the line\n```\nsrc/main.js\n```\nto ignore the file **main.js** under the **src/** directory.\n\n![A screenshot of a Linux terminal showing the creation of a .gitignore file using the command \"touch .gitignore\". Next, the commands \"ls\" and \"ls -a\" are used to show that since .gitignore is a hidden file, the \"-a\" flag is necessary](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/gitignore/create-gitignore.png)\n\n**Note**: since **.gitignore** is a hidden file, we will need to add the `-a` flag to `ls` to see it.\n\n### Ignore a directory with .gitignore\nSometimes we want to ignore entire directories or specify certain files in a directory. Common directories to leave out of a Git repository are **node_modules** or **logs** folder. We can ignore an entire directory by simply adding its name to **.gitignore**:\n```\nnode_modules/\n```\nThis will ignore the **node_modules** directory, and all subdirectories and files inside them. The forward slash `/` specifies that we are ignoring the directory.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12e039ee01700124c0bc1\" /\u003e\n\n### .gitignore Patterns\nWe can take advantage of [patterns](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) to match multiple filenames. These help us handle special cases such as ignoring specific file types or ignoring all but one file inside a directory. Some examples of things that make up patterns are:\n* Wildcard `*` to match 0 or more characters except for `/`. For example, adding `*.html` to **.gitignore** would ignore all files ending with the `.html` extension. `example*` would match any file starting with `example` such as `example.txt` or `exampleHtmlFile.html`.\n* Negation `!` as a prefix to negate any file that would otherwise be ignored. For example, \n```\nindex*\n!public/index.css\n```\nwill ignore all files starting with `index` except for `src/index.css`. But, we cannot negate a file inside an ignored directory.\n* Square brackets `[]` can be used to match a single character from a set of characters or a range of characters. Note that the range can be alphabetical: `[a-z]` or `[A-Z]`, numeric `[0-9]`, or a set of characters. If we added `index.[a-i]*` with both the square bracket and wildcard to **.gitignore**, we would ignore `index.css` and `index.html` but not `index.js`, since \"j\" is outside of the `[a-i]` range.\n* Double asterisk `**` is used to match 0 or more directories. If we had a **temp** folder inside all of the folders in the root directory and we only wanted to match files with the `.log` extension, we could use the pattern `**/temp/*.log`.\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"61b12f6bb2791a001c367599\" /\u003e\n\n## GitHub Provided Templates\nWhen we create a new repository on GitHub, we have the option to add a **.gitignore** file from a list of templates. These templates are pulled from [GitHub’s gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore). For example, below is the template for Java projects.\n```\n# Compiled class file\n*.class\n\n# Log file\n*.log\n\n# BlueJ files\n*.ctxt\n\n# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)\n.mtj.tmp/\n\n# Package Files #\n*.jar\n*.war\n*.nar\n*.ear\n*.zip\n*.tar.gz\n*.rar\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nGood job on completing this article! .gitignore files are incredibly useful to make sure our repositories are only tracking changes on relevant files. They also ensure that we can keep files with sensitive data out of the staging area. You’ll come across **.gitignore** files in almost every project on GitHub.\n\nThis file is shared by the repository, so make sure your patterns are correct and take your time with creating your first **.gitignore** file! \n","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"c8f5d85e5c164f42ee9d438bed97d7dd","started":false,"startedAt":null,"completed":false,"completedAt":null,"userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":null,"record":null}},"Article:f2c09be69043e44351a8d09c6607c02f":{"__typename":"Article","id":"f2c09be69043e44351a8d09c6607c02f","description":"Learn how to use Git Rebase in order to rewrite the history of your repository.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"git-rebase","title":"How To Use Git Rebase","time":15,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"When working with a Git repository, there will be a time when we need to combine changes from a working branch into another one. This can be accomplished with the use of the commands `merge` or  `rebase`. In this article, we’ll focus on `rebase` and see how it can work some magic in order to manage the future development of a product by simplifying git history. \n\n## What is Git Rebase?\n\nAt a high level, rebasing can be understood as “moving the base of a branch onto a different position”.  Think of it like a redo — “I meant to start here.” \n\nConsider that a team just completed a production release. While working on a completely new feature branch called `new_feature`, a co-worker finds a bug in the production release (`main` branch). In order to fix this, a team member creates a `quick_fix` branch, squashes the bug, and merges their code in to the `main` branch. At this point, the `main` branch and the `new_feature` branch have diverged and they each have a different commit history. We can visualize this in the image below:\n\n![A diagram showing that before rebase, branch commits stick out from the main line of development.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/before-rebase.svg)\n\nIf we want to bring the updated changes from `main` into `new_feature` one could use the `merge` command, but with `rebase` we can keep the Git commit history clean and easy to follow. By “rebasing” the `new_feature` branch onto the `main` one, we move all the changes made from `new_feature` to the front of `main` and incorporate the new commits by rewriting its history. We can see how this is done below:\n\n![A diagram showing that after rebase, commits over multiple branches get flattened into a single line.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/after-rebase.svg) \n\nWe can see above that the new “base” of our `new_feature` branch is the updated `main` branch with the previous changes from the bug fix implemented.\n\nOne of the major benefits of using Git rebase is that it eliminates unnecessary merge commits required by `git merge`. Most importantly, the history of the changes made in the main repository remains linear and follows a clear path of changes. This allows us to navigate the changes easier when viewing the changes in a `log` or `graph`. \n\n### Merge vs Rebase\n\nAlthough `git rebase` is an extremely useful tool to keep a Git repository clean and easy to follow, it doesn’t mean that one should _always_ stick to that command when integrating code changes. Let’s go over the definitions of `rebase` and `merge` one more time:\n\n- Git rebase: Reapplies commits on top of another base branch.\n\n- Git merge: joins two or more development histories together (creating a new merge commit).\n\nIn other words, Git merge preserves history as it happened, whereas rebase rewrites it. \n\nGenerally, if one is dealing with numerous branches, and the commit graph becomes really difficult to read, it can be very useful to use rebase instead of merge. Since Git rebase creates a linear history, it can be a lot easier to visualize the changes made and get a cleaner graph.\n\n![In the diagram, the history from only using Git merge shows lots of different paths representing different branches. Next to it, the path from using Git rebase is one straight line, with commits from a feature branch getting represented as a commit on the main branch.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/git-rebase/git-merge-vs-git-rebase.svg)\n\nIn the end, each team will develop their preferred method of integrating changes and preserving history. \nGenerally, it’s useful to use `merge` whenever we want to add changes of a branch **back** into the base branch. And `rebase` is useful whenever we want to add **changes of a base branch** back to a branched out branch. \n\n### Disadvantages of using rebase\n\nAs useful as Git rebase can be, it doesn’t come without risks. When using `git rebase` in our workflow it’s imperative to understand that rebase is a **destructive operation** and creates _new_ commits, which can make it complicated to track the context of any changes made. One common rule when using rebase is to only use it locally. That is to say, once something has been pushed then **do not** rebase it after that. Otherwise, things can get convoluted when rewriting history on a remote. \n\nSince we’re rewriting history we will also have to solve more commit conflicts. When we merge a branch, we only need to solve the conflicts once straight into the merge commit. However, when using rebase we might end up having to solve similar conflicts in previous commits that are being rewritten because rebase practically cherry-picks each commit individually and attempts to merge it in. If a commit introduces a conflict, rebase will complain about it even if the conflict is fixed in subsequent commits. In order to reduce the number of merge conflicts, it's suggested to rebase often and to also squash changes into one commit as much as possible.\n\nMoreover, make sure that the branch we're working on is not a shared branch. A shared branch meaning a branch that exists on the distant repository and that other people on our team could pull. Why should we avoid this? Well, remember that rebasing changes **commit history**. So if we share our commits publicly, and others start additional work based on those commits, our trees are no longer in sync after rebasing. As a golden rule, it’s important to only use rebase on a local branch that we're working on individually.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGit rebase can be a very powerful tool when working with numerous people and branches, if used correctly it allows everyone to view a very clean commit history and track what commits fixed given defects or whether or not a commit was included in a release. However, it’s critical to understand how it works and the risks that come with it since it’s a destructive operation. If done so correctly, it can result in a very fluid and effective workflow.\n","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"f2c09be69043e44351a8d09c6607c02f","started":false,"startedAt":null,"completed":false,"completedAt":null,"userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":null,"record":null}},"KanbanProjectTask:bb2f17ebfcd3450783b8e126c9e6d6bc":{"__typename":"KanbanProjectTask","description":"To obtain a local copy of the repository, you will fork it and then clone it onto your local machine.

Displaying and sharing code is easy. Users can create profiles to save interesting codebases, follow other users, and host their code. We'll discuss how to round out a GitHub profile and how to be engaged in all that the community has to offer!\n\n## Github Profiles\n\nWith GitHub profiles, users can follow other users and see what they work on in their careers. A well-rounded GitHub profile will not only look good to recruiters but boost reputability when we want to make contributions to open source projects.\n\nA good GitHub profile will have several different projects, ideally with different concepts driving each project. Each project should have a well-written `README` document. This shows that the user can communicate their work with other developers through good code documentation.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/github-profile.svg\" alt=\"A diagram imitation of a GitHub profile, which includes the user photo, different projects stored in different repositories called Code Art, JavaScript Tools, and Personal Website. At the bottom, there is a contribution counter to show how often the user works on their code.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnother thing that suggests a well-rounded GitHub profile would be a filled-out activity tracker that displays how many contributions the user makes daily, whether to their own projects or community ones. \n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4a2d448b710016ffc299\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4cc9448b710016ffc2a2\" /\u003e\n\n## Exploring Code on GitHub\n\nA great way to find inspiration for your projects is to use GitHub's search feature. You can search for specific companies, developers, and even projects. For instance, you can easily search for projects relating to a Discord chatbot and then choose the target language, like C#. If you want to contribute to a Discord bot built-in C# or grab some code to get yourself started on a chatbot, you can! \n\nAnother great place to look for projects pertaining to certain topics is the [GitHub Topics page](https://github.com/topics). Here, projects are grouped by topics like Arduino projects and algorithms.\n\nEven if you don't know what to look for, [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) will use existing projects in your GitHub profile to automatically find other projects you might be interested in. And, to see what other developers are currently interested in, you can check out [what's trending](https://github.com/trending) in the GitHub community!\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/github-trending-page.png\" alt=\"The image shows GitHub's trending page, full of recent popular projects from around the world.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b4b931c625a00136c0888\" /\u003e\n\n## Open Source Projects On GitHub\n\nOpen source projects have their code open to the public and usually take code submissions from the developer community. For instance, NASA, Facebook, and Google all use GitHub for open-source projects. That means developers outside of those organizations volunteer to help with bug fixes and experiment on new features.\n\nWhile a company or developer might not want all of their projects to be open source, many big companies maintain open-source projects to stay in touch with the wider developer community and generate user interest. Google has many repositories where the broader community collaborates:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-community/google-open-source.png\" alt=\"Google's almost 2000 open repositories. At the top of the Google organization's page, the description says Google hearts Open Source.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnother example is Facebook has a repository named [Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly) which is used internally and has over 10,000 commits from developers from all over the world. That means that anyone who has made a commit to Folly can technically say they've helped add on to a project being used by Facebook.\n\nMaking contributions to open-source projects is a great way to grow your skill and experience. To contribute, you can start at any repository's issues page, where bugs and potential new features are listed.  Then, you can fork the repository to work on a specific issue and eventually make a pull request.\n\nYou can take a look at [these current open discussions in the Folly repository](https://github.com/facebook/folly/issues).\n\n\u003cAssessment id=\"617b489a22ca920017cc1624\" /\u003e\n\nNow that you know more about the GitHub community, feel free to start building up your profile by creating your own projects! You can also start exploring GitHub for other projects that you can fork or star. As you gain more experience, start looking at issues in projects and start fixing them!\n\n\n\n","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"cc6b56e2110a38780797c9bc702b5b20","started":false,"startedAt":null,"completed":false,"completedAt":null,"userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":null,"record":null}},"Article:e684b918f7c2bc76f9c93971ac1112a4":{"__typename":"Article","id":"e684b918f7c2bc76f9c93971ac1112a4","description":"This article links to a project to complete in a public GitHub repository.

We can see open issues, make pull requests, link pull requests to issues, and even merge pull requests without touching the GitHub UI.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll download the GitHub CLI and practice a few commands on an existing project.\n\n## Installation\nDownload and execute the installer for your operating system from the  GitHub CLI public webpage. Once the installation is complete, open a new terminal and verify the default configuration: \n\n```\ngh --version \n```\n\nReview the list of the supported APIs and functionalities: \n\n```\ngh --help\n```\n\n## GitHub CLI in action\n[Fork the try-GitHub-cli-off-platform-project repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/try-github-CLI-off-platform-project) to your GitHub account and clone it onto your local computer. Next, open a terminal and change the current directory to the directory of the cloned repository.\n\nThe repository contains a simple Python application for a Magic Eight Ball. The application, however, has a defect. The code tries to use the Python `random` library without importing it. \n\nLogin to GitHub from your terminal using GitHub CLI and follow the instructions to complete the authentication.\n\n```\n\u003e gh auth login\n```\n\nUse the command line to create a GitHub Issue documenting the problem:\n\n```\n\u003e gh issue create --title \"Fix magic8.py error\" --body \"The code for magic8.py uses the Python random library without importing it. This causes issues during runtime.\"\n```\n\nFollow the instructions in the terminal and select the forked repository to create the issue. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-cli/github-CLI-create-issue.png\" alt=\"In the command line, we see the result of using the gh issue create command. We see a prompt that allows you to fix the title and body of the issue. There are options to submit or continue in the browser.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOnce the issue is created, you can view it on GitHub web interface under the Issues tab. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-cli/github-cli-resulting-issue.png\" alt=\"The resulting issue called Fix magic8.py error on the GitHub UI, with the title and body we submitted earlier from the command line.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can also use GitHub CLI to  list all opened issues so far:\n\n```\ngh issue status\n```\n\nLet's now create a new branch to actually fix the issue. \n\n```\ngit checkout -b “fix-magic8 ”\n```\n\nOpen the `magic8.py` file using an editor of your choice and add the following line at the beginning of the file to fix the defect: \n\n```\nimport random\n```\n\nCommit and push your change to the remote. \n\n```\ngit commit -a -m “Fixed magic8.py file by importing the proper required library”\ngit push --set-upstream origin fix-magic8\n```\n\nNow that there's a full solution to the problem in your branch, it's time to create a pull request! You can use the command line to directly make a pull request:\n\n```\ngh pr create\n```\n\nFollow the prompts and add the proper title and description for the pull request. Mention the id of the issue in the description following `#[id]` format so that GitHub automatically links the pull request to the issue. The following is an example description: \n\n\u003e This pull request imports the random library in magic8.py. Once merged, this resolves #1.\n\nTo check if this actually worked, you can check that the new pull request appears under the Pull Requests tab. Also, observe the state of the issue and see that the issue is now linked to the pull request. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/github-cli/github-cli-linked-pull-request-to-issue.png\" alt=\"On the GitHub web UI, we now see that the issue we created we linked to the new pull request that we created from the terminal.\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAssuming that your pull request is good to go, you can merge your pull request using the following GitHub CLI command:\n\n```\ngh pr merge\n```\n\nOnce the pull request is merged, check back the status of the issues and notice that the issue is now closed and no longer listed under the open issues: \n\n```\ngh issue status\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWell done! You've now successfully used terminal commands to interact with GitHub APIs. GitHub terminal commands streamline code development as they enable developers to integrate a repository's pull requests and issues into terminal commands and bash scripts. GitHub CLI is a powerful and convenient tool!\n\nWant to learn more about terminal commands?

This is a built-in GitHub tracking tool for all the bugs, errors, and potential small feature changes for the project living inside the repository. In one view, collaborators of the repository can see what needs to be worked on (open issues) as well as which tasks were resolved (closed issues). Take a look at the [Codecademy docs Issue board](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/issues):\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/issues-board-docs.png\" alt=\"The image shows a board of about 10-15 tasks that each have a title, a user associated, and multiple labels that indicate language or type of issue.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe issue board acts as a forum for all the collaborators of the repository. In some instances, issue boards are public and users of a project can submit and discuss bugs they've encountered.\n\n#### Labels\nTo help organize issues when more and more pop up in a project, we can use labels. `bug` and `feature` are common labels used to differentiate between errors and new features. In the Codecademy Docs repo Issue board earlier, we could see labels such as `Good first issue`, if a suggested entry to Docs is `new` or an `edit`, and what language the entry should be in, like `C#` or `Java`. Labels help us toggle between different types of issues at a glance and have short names.\n\n#### Creating an Issue\nTo create an Issue, we can click the `New Issue` button on top of the Issues board. This will take us to a new page where to set the title and content of the issue. \n\nIssues are a bit like pull requests in that we want to keep the title specific but to the point. For descriptions, repositories often have their own guidelines (just like pull requests do) for including details. For example, if the issue is related to a bug, we should include the error message in the description. Check out a complete issue from the Facebook Folly repository:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/completed-issue.png\" alt=\"An issue with a title Typedef redefinition #1658. The user included in the description the error message they encountered. The history shows where else this issue was mentioned and closed and reopened.\"\u003e\n\nOnce the issue is posted and now open, collaborators and other GitHub users can add to the discussion and reference this issue by the `#` in other issues and pull requests.\n\n## GitHub Project Management\n\nGitHub projects is a beta feature (as of late 2021) for project management. While other project management tools exist, like JIRA or even handwritten post-its, GitHub projects allow direct integration within the repository, letting developers stay within the same ecosystem. We can also create automated project boards that trigger the status of issues and pull requests. And… it's completely free!\n\nTo try out projects, we can select the `New Project` option after clicking the `+` button on the upper right side of the GitHub dashboard. In most cases, projects are linked to repositories, which already have existing issues and pull requests, but in other cases, projects can be standalone.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/new-project.png\" alt=\"The dropdown menu from the top right of the GitHub dashboard, which shows the New Project option.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\nAfter filling out the name and description of the new project, a drop-down will appear asking what Project template we want to use. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/project-types.png\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"The different project types include None, Basic kanban, Automated kanban, Automated kanban with reviews, and Bug triage.\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe options range from different types of Kanban boards that can host issues and pull requests to a Bug Triage, which gives details into which bugs are high priority, low priority, or need further investigation. Once the board is created, we will [add issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board) to it.\n\nAn example of a laid-out GitHub project board is [Github's own public roadmap project](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/1), shown next. This is an example of a Project with no repository, as a roadmap can be used for organizational purposes.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-git-github/project-management/github-project-board.png\" alt=\"The GitHub public roadmap that includes major issues (each with labels) for each quarter.\"\u003e\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we learned about two GitHub features that can come in handy for teams: issues and projects.  We can use GitHub issues to keep track of tasks that need to be worked on. Those issues can then be referenced in pull requests, comments, or projects. GitHub projects are an even newer feature for project management purposes and can be linked to repositories. We can choose from a variety of different board types to organize tasks.\n\nWe encourage you to try these out if you want to incorporate project management into your GitHub experience!\n","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"59213c16722bda2f3f29cdbf5042aa19","started":false,"startedAt":null,"completed":false,"completedAt":null,"userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":null,"record":null}},"Article:a6c6ded77782d171d072c93332650fdf":{"__typename":"Article","id":"a6c6ded77782d171d072c93332650fdf","description":"In this article, you'll learn about how GitHub Actions streamline the development workflow.

Or have you ever worked in a team where everyone promised the final version would work fine but ended up [erroring]? This is called the \"works on my machine\" syndrome in software development. \n\nNow imagine we could configure your [GitHub] repository to automatically run tests to verify the functionality of the codebase after each code change. Well… we can, using **GitHub Actions**!\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\n[GitHub Actions] is a powerful, advanced GitHub feature that enables users to define custom and automated workflows triggered on various types of events such as [pushing code] or [creating a pull request]. The workflows execute inside a temporary container running in GitHub infrastructure.\n\n## Tutorial: add automated testing to a repository\n\nIn this tutorial project, you will use GitHub Actions to integrate automatic unit tests to a repository. You will fork a public repository that contains a sample bank application and add a configuration to trigger (already written) unit tests in the repository. Try your best to follow along!\n\n### Bank account application\n\nThe [Bank Account repository] contains Python Flask application code to manage the balance of an imaginary checking account. To understand this tutorial, you don't need extensive Python knowledge or experience with the Flask framework. If you're curious though, the `README.md` file includes more details about the code. \n\n### Run tests on code push\n\nNow that we know what GitHub Actions are and how they enhance development workflows, let's continue by adding an action to a repository. Start by forking and then cloning [Codecademy's Bank Account repository]. Once you clone your forked copy of the repository from your GitHub account onto your local computer, create a new branch: \n\n```shell\ngit checkout -b \"add-auto-tests\"\n```\n\nIn your new branch, create a new directory and name it `.github`. Note that the dot in the beginning of the directory name is important. This is a keyword known to GitHub. \n\nThen create another directory inside the `.github` directory and name it `workflows`. GitHub looks for the definitions of GitHub Actions inside this directory. \n\nCreate a new `.yaml` file inside the directory. Let's name it `unittests.yaml` and paste the following content inside the file. Note that the indentation and spacing are important. \n\n```bash\nname: Continuous Integration\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Set up Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.10.0\n          architecture: x64\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: pip install -r requirements.txt \n      - name: Run Tests\n        run: python -m pytest\n```\n\nThe file introduces a new GitHub Action named `Continuous Integration` that is triggered on `push`, meaning that everytime a developer pushes a code to a branch where this file exists. The action then runs the following steps in the order of their definition on an `ubuntu-latest` container:\n\n1. Check out to the current Git branch.\n2. Set up Python on the container.\n3. Install the Python dependencies of the Bank Account app defined in `requirements.txt`.\n4. Run the unit tests using Pytest.\n\nAdd and commit your changes, then push the branch out to your remote repository on your GitHub account: \n\n```shell\ngit add . \ngit commit -a -m \"added a GitHub action to run unit tests automatically on code push\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin \"add-auto-tests\"\n```\n\nNow open your repository in a browser and navigate under the Actions tab. You should see a new workflow started a few seconds ago:\n\n![\"A new workflow being run in the GitHub Actions tab.\"]\n\nClick on the workflow to show the details. The logs for every individual step are available: \n\n![\"Workflow details showing the log for every step taken in the GitHub action.\"]\n\nClick through the steps to read the logs. Once the workflow finishes, you will see a green checkmark. If any of the unit tests fail, the workflow fails and you will see an email notification. You can try that by intentionally breaking one of the tests and pushing your code to your branch. \n\n### Run tests on pull request creation \n\nNow let`s make this GitHub Action workflow also run the tests when creating a new pull request. \n\nOpen `unittests.yaml` file and update the array of triggers to add `pull_request`:\n\n```shell\non: [push, pull_request]\n```\n\nCommit and push your change to the branch. Notice that an instance of a container to run the tests will begin under the Actions tab just like before. But now, create a pull request from the `add-auto-tests` branch to your `main` branch (on your own repository). The GitHub action will then run as an automated check and ensure the unit tests pass. If the action fails, the pull request cannot be merged. \n\n![\"All GitHub actions have run and passed the pull request checks.\"]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGitHub Actions enable automated workflows for developers. In this tutorial, we were able to add automated testing to a repository, which ensures quality control over the code. We encourage you to explore more GitHub Actions that can be configured to run other types of automation: docker builds, project compilation, tagging, releasing, and more!","progress({\"userId\":\"5ececf094176810bbd7febba\"})":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","contentItemId":"a6c6ded77782d171d072c93332650fdf","started":false,"startedAt":null,"completed":false,"completedAt":null,"userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5ececf094176810bbd7febba","lastUpdated":null,"record":null}},"Track:a8ab218d5950c29861635cc0bf12fd13":{"__typename":"Track","id":"a8ab218d5950c29861635cc0bf12fd13","title":"Learn Git \u0026 GitHub","slug":"learn-git","categories":[{"__typename":"Category","slug":"technical-recruiter","title":"Technical Recruiter","classification":"role"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"web-development","title":"Web Development","classification":"subject"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"open-source","title":"Open Source","classification":"subject"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"computer-science","title":"Computer Science","classification":"subject"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"developer-tools","title":"Developer Tools","classification":"subject"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"bash","title":"Bash/Shell","classification":"language"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"sales-engineer","title":"Sales Engineer","classification":"role"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"git-hub","title":"GitHub","classification":"skill"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"git","title":"Git","classification":"skill"},{"__typename":"Category","slug":"computer-science-domain","title":"Computer Science Domain","classification":"domain"}],"createdAt":"2018-04-30T17:32:32Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-21T21:31:14Z","published":true,"completionMessage":"","shortDescription":"Use our beginner friendly Git course to integrate Git and GitHub and manage versions of your projects using Git branches.
